The Paleo Diet is a high protein, low carb way of eating that's supposed to copy the diet of our ancestors, "the cave man diet".

It's believed our ancestors were hunter gatherers and they had much better health so following their way of eating shoud improve our health.

The Paleo Diet has shown tremendous benefit for some, though it can also be hard to follow and hard to maintain for many. 

Here are keypoints the studies and research reviews show on the Paleo Diet;

Overview
    - The Paleo Diet is supposed to copy our  hunter-gatherer ancestors way of eating
    - The idea came about in the 1970's but gained popularity in 2002 after Loren Cordain published a book about it
    - It also gained a boost in popularity when the sport of Crossfit started to grow, which highly advocated the diet
    - The Paleo Diet includes whole foods such as fruit, meat, veggies, fish, and poultry 
    - Processed foods, grains, legumes, and artificial sweeteners are highly discouraged 
    - There are many small tweaks that people make to the diet to make it more fitting to them, though this would not technically be considered a true Paleo Diet at that point 
    
How to Paleo Diet 
    - Limit any food that wouldn't have been available to hunter-gatherer ancestors
    - These limited foods include processed foods, grains, legumes, dairy products, sugar, artificial sweeteners
    - Eat minimally processed whole foods, such as meat, fish, poultry, fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats
    - No need to count calories because these foods naturally lead to better health and satiation
    - Some modified Paleo Diets allow grass-fed butter and gluten-free grains or legumes in moderation

Paleo Diet health 
    - Paleo Diet supports eating nutrient-rich whole foods and discourages processed foods (which are high in empty calories and contribute to weight gain)
    - It's high in protein which reduces levels of ghrelin (the hormone responsible for feelings of hunger)
    - Studies show that the Paleo Diet helps increase weight loss
    - One study showed an average of 14 pounds lost in 6 months, with large reduction of belly fat and muscle gain
    - Studies show improved good cholesterol (HDL, high density lipoproteins) and reduced triglyceride levels as well as lower bad cholesterol (LDL, low density lipoproteins)
    - The Paleo Diet can reduce blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, and triglycerides, which are all risk factors for heart disease  (the leading cause of death world wide)

Paleo Diet and blood sugar 
    - Paleo Diet can reduce blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity 
    - Insulin is a hormine that regulates blood sugar 
    - Increased insulin sensitivity improves our ability to use insulin efficiently and supports healthy blood sugar levels
    - Studies show enhanced insulin sensitivity by up to 45%
    - Studies show the diet more effective at lowering levels of hemoglobin A1C (marker of long-term blood sugar levels) than traditional diabetes diets
