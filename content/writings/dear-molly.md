title: Dear Molly 
---

How you been? How you doin? 

Never hear from you these days

Admit sometimes I miss you 

But I’m glad you stay away

---

Cut off all our mutual friends 

Don’t want to hear about you 

Hope I never see your face

You were the hardest heartbreak 

---

We dated for a minute 

50 months to be exact 

You wouldn’t stop coming back 

And you popped up everywhere 

---

I swear you were stalking me 

Yeah things were so good at first 

Helped me truly be myself 

Gave me so much confidence 

---

Let go of all my ego 

But then our problems began 

You got inside of my head 

And started playing these games

---

Told me I was worth nothing 

Filled me with nothing but shame 

So guilty for who I was 

And then the depression came 

---

Thinking I shouldn’t exist 

I’m thinking of suicide 

Like why should I be alive? 

All I do is hurt people 

---

I thought that you were my friend 

You turned out to be so fake

Take you out every weekend 

Only bad decisions made 

---

Got so lonely without you 

Got feeling so damn empty 

No confidence when you’re gone 

Losing myself completely 

---

I thought you were helping me 

To be a better person 

But I slowly saw the truth 

---

Brought a gun into my room 

Now what kind of friend are you?

What friend would let me do that?

---

Dear Molly I hate you now

You are nothing but a fake 

That wanted the death of me 

---

Now that I’m thinking bout it 

I do not miss you at all 

Would rather drink alcohol 

All you do is bring me down 

---

Ruined my relationships 

Should never have trusted you 

This is my final goodbye 

Relationship down the drain
