Tired

18-wheeler tired 
But Ferrari for my drive 
Live close to the edge 

But I never dive 
Might hang off by fingertips 
When I’m most alive 

I’ll never fall off 
Until the day that I die 
The life that I chose 

Highest highs, real lows 
But that’s the life that I chose 
Sometimes drown in my woes 

Success suffocates 
Fall asleep chasing the thrill 
I will not complain 

I make my own bed 
And when I’m too tired to move 
Pass out on the edge 

Michelin man tired 
But Lamborghini my drive 
Wait, brake, shift, change gears 

More like Bugatti 
Because when I’m most tired 
I’m still so alive
