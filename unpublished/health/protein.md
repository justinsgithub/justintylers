Proteins are 1 of the 4 macronutrients aside from carbs, alcohol, and fats. 
1 gram of protein is equal to 4 calories. 
It's good to shoot for .5 - 1 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day 

The word protein comes from the greek word "proteos" (meaning 'primary' or 'first place').

Here are keypoints about proteins and their different functions; 

Overview
    - Proteins are made of little amino acids that combine to form amino acid chains.
    - Visualize protein as a necklace made of beads, where each bead is an amino acid 
    - Different combinations of beads (amino acids) make different necklaces of proteins
    - There are 20 amino acids that help form thousands of different proteins inside your body
    - Proteins have numerous jobs aside from muscle repair 
    
Tissue growth and maintenance
    - Our bodies need consistent protein for growth and maintenance of tissues 
    - Normally our body breaks down same amount of protein that it uses to build and repair tissues
    - Sometimes we break down more protein than we can create (such as from strenous workouts) which increases our bodies needs of it 
    - Too much protein breakdown also happens during periods of illness, during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding
    - Athletes, older adults, and those recovering from an injury or surgery require more protein than normal 

Biochemical Reactions
    - Enzymes are proteins that help thousands of biochemical reactions in your body
    - Structure of enzymes allow them to combine with other molecules inside the cell (substrates)
    - Substrates catalyze reactions that are essentials to your metabolism
    - Enzymes function inside and outside the cell
    - Digestive enzymes lactase and sucrase help digest sugar
    - Some enzymes need other molecules like vitamins or minerals for a reaction to take place 
    
Bodily functions that need enzymes 
    - Digestion 
    - Energy production 
    - Blood clotting
    - Muscle contraction 
    
Proteins are messengers
    - Some proteins are hormones, which are chemical messengers for the body 
    - Hormones are used to communicate between your cells, tissues, and organs
    - Hormones are made and secreted by endocrine tissues or glands and then transported in our blood to their target tissues or organs where they bind to protein receptors on the cell surface 
    
There are 3 main categories of hormones 
    - Protein and peptides (made from chains of amino acids, ranging from a few to several hundred)
    - Steriods (made from the fat cholesterol, such as the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen)
    - Amines (made from the individual amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine, which make hormones related to sleep and metabolism)
    
Protein and polypeptides make up most your body's hormones, examples below

Insulin
    - Signals uptake of glucose / sugar into the cell 
Glucagon 
    - Signals breakdown of stored glucose in the liver
HGH (human growth hormone)
    - Stimulates growth of various tissues including bone
ADH (antidiuretic hormone)
    - Signals the kidneys to reabsorb water
ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)
    - Stimulates the release of cortisol, a key factor in metabolism

Proteins give structure 
    - Some proteins are fibrous, providing cells and tissues with stiffness and rigidity
    - Some of these proteins include keratin, collagen, and elastin
    - The above proteins help form connective frameworks of some structures in your body
    - Keratin helps with our skin, hair, and nails
    - Collagen is the most popular protein in our body
    - Collagen helps with our bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin 
    - Elastin (like elastic) is hundreds of times more flexible than collagen
    - Elastins elasticity allows many tissues in our bodies return to their original shape after stretching or contracting
    - Examples of this are the uterus, lungs, and arteries
    
Protein balances pH (potential of hydrogen)
    - Proteins help regulate the levels of acids and bases in our body 
    - Balance between acids and bases is measured using pH scale 
    - pH scale range from 0 - 14, 0 most acidic, 7 neutral, 14 most alkaline
    - A constant pH is necessary for optimal health, even a slight change in pH can be harmful or even deadly
    - Your body uses proteins to help regulate pH, such as with hemoglobin (protein that makes up red blood cells)
    - Hemoglobin binds small amounts of acid, helping keep our pH normal 
    - Other systems that balance pH in the body include phosphate and bicarbonate

Proteins balance fluids
    - Albumin and globulin are proteins in our blood that maintain our fluid balance by attracting and retaining water
    - Without enough protein in our diet, levels of albumin and globulin eventually decrease
    - Without these proteins, we can no longer keep blood in our blood vessels and fluid is forced into the spaces between our cells
    - As fluid builds up swelling or edema occurs, (water weight) especially in the stomach region 
    - kwashiorkor is a very rare form of severe protein malnutrition where a person is getting enough calories but not enough protein 
    
Proteins help the immune system 
    - Proteins help form immunoglobulins (antibodies) to fight infection
    - Antibodies are proteins in our blood that help protect our bodies from things like bacteria and viruses
    - When bacteria or viruses enter our cells, our body makes antibodies to tag them for elimination 
    - WIthout antibodies, bacteria and viruses would multiply until they take over our body with disease
    - After our body makes antibodies against a certain bacteria or virus, our cells never forget how to make them 
    - With that memory our antibodies can act quickly whenever that certain bacteria or virus invades us again
    - This results in our immunity against the diseases we are exposed to 

Proteins transport nutrients
    - Transport proteins carry substances through our bloodstream to and from cells, and within cells
    - Substances proteins transport include nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, blood sugar, cholesterol, oxygen
    - Hemoglobin is a protein that transports oxygen from lungs to body tissues 
    - Glucose transporters (GLUT) move glucose to our cells 
    - Lipoproteins transport cholesterol and other fats in our blood
    - Transport proteins are specific to the substance they transfer, a protein transporter for glucose will not transport cholesterol
    - Proteins also have a storage role
    - Ferritin is a storage protein for iron 
    - Casein is a storage protein
    - Casein is the main protein in milk that helps babies grow

Energy 
    - Proteins are a form of calories which means they supply the body with energy 
    - Proteins have 4 calories per gram 
    - Carbs have 4 calories per gram 
    - Fats have 9 calories per gram 
    - Alcohol have 7 calories per gram 
    - Our bodies use protein for energy as a last resort since it has so many other important applications in our bodies
    - Our body prefers carbs the most for energy, but we can make it efficient at using fat and it will use alcohol as energy immediately over everything else 
    - Carbs and fats are better suited for giving us energy and our body metabolizes them better
    - Proteins rarely give us energy (although adequate protein may make us feel healthier and therefore more energized)
    - In states of fasting 18 - 48 hours, our body breaks down skeletal muscle for amino acids to use for energy 
    - Our body will also use amino acids from skeletal muscle on extremely low carb diets or over training without the proper amount of calories and protein to support it
