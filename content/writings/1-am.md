title: 1 AM

1 am in the morning

My mind keeps me from sleep

Too much racing through it

So I let the day begin

---

Only slept for like 4 hours 

But I guess that is enough 

Cause my mind just won’t shut off 

Wonder why I think so much 

---

Technically it’s morning time 

Maybe I’m just missing you 

Missing my family too 

Just had a dream about them 

---

Actually more like nightmare 

And now I just can’t find sleep 

Wonder how my sister's been 

Wonder how my brother’s doing 

---

But nobody to talk to 

Cause it’s only 1 am 

Lay here and think about work 

How’s the day going to go? 

---

Who all is on the schedule?

What projects are coming up?

Then think about my workouts

Am I pushing hard enough?

What am I even pushing for?

---

Met some cool people today

Hope my impression was good

Had some fun conversations 

Talked to a couple cute girls 

Am I a failure, how am I not?

---

Thinking about myself too much

Then I think about the world 

I really want to sleep 

But my mind just won’t let me
