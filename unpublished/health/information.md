Information 
by Justin Tyler

Life, the world, is a constant exchange of energy and information. 
Our body language gives information. 
Our words and tone of voice gives information. 

We are constantly getting new information from different sources. 
Such as our phones, news feeds, social media. Our guts, muscles, bodies tell us information.
The earth's soil and the food we eat gives us information. 
The news, our daily interactions, our instincts give us information.

It's up to us as individuals to process all the information we get on a daily basis. 
We need to decide for ourselves what information is true or false. 
Decide which information is helpful and which to ignore.
To really be the best we can be, we must be aware, conscience, and do research ourselves. 

All of the studies and science in the world is available for free on the internet for us to use. 
We just need to care enough to spend the time to learn how to use it, to make the best decisions. 
Think for ourselves instead of letting strangers tell us what to think and what to do. 

You can choose to spread and contribute to the good, healthy, and true information in the world. You can learn and do your own research to make knowledgeable decisions, or go with whatever everyone else or the news chooses for you.
