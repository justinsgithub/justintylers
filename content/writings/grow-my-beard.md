title: Grow My Beard
date: 2021
---

Been thinking I might grow out my beard

Already shaved my head 

Show how much I don't care what you think

But I'm fooling myself

Who am I kidding?

---

Grow my beard to make my face more fitting

Maybe it will make me look more serious

Make me look cool

Look smarter 

But it's been a few weeks 

And I just look like a fool 

---

Here I am again

Trying to be someone different 

Like a beard would make a difference

I really like myself

Just spent so much time away

Forgot who I was 

Remembering who I am 

More myself every day

---

I guess I don't need a beard

Guess I'll grow my hair back too 

Done with my time of shame

Back on the move 

Comfortable with the truth

Really feeling myself

Want to be no one else 

Knocked my problems off the shelf

Maybe I won't grow a beard

I'll just be myself

I like me the best
