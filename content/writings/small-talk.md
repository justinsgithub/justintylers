Don't mean to be rude

I've been practicing candor

Being honest and open as I can

I can't stand for small talk 

At least for the moment

Got too much to do 

Not enough time in the day 

For an empty response from you 

To respond to an empty "Hey" 

---

Too much on my mind

Never enough time in a day

Been searching for meaning

No time for an empty "whats up"

You already know I'm always working

---

It stresses me out to text 

What do I say next 

Just feels a little awkward

Pointless conversations I have ten times in my head

---

Don't want to hurt your feelings

But empty messages hurt me 

I'm searching for meaning

Trying to spread some light

So just be straight, tell me what your feeling

I'm in no mood for anymore wasted nights

---

Life is short, no seconds to spare

Doing things with no love

Won't spend my life on a screen

Something I wouldn't dare 

Don't stay on my cellphone

Refuse to sit and stare

That's not what life's about

If you disagree, well I don't care

---

Might post on social media

But I rarely scroll

Tech turns people to zombies

I've seen it take it's toll

---

I refuse to be like that

Don't let my phone consume me

So it'll probably be a while before I text back 

If you care that much then call me
