1 am in the morning 
My mind keeps me from sleep 
Too much racing through my mind
So I let the day begin 

Only slept for like 4 hours 
But I guess that is enough 
Cause my mind just won’t shut off 
Wonder why I think so much 

Technically it’s morning time 
Maybe I’m just missing you 
Missing my family too 
Just had a dream about them 

Actually more like nightmare 
And now I just can’t find sleep 
Wonder how my sisters been 
Wonder how my bro’s doing 

But nobody to talk to 
Cause it’s only 1 am 
Lay here and think about work 
How’s the day going to go? 

Who all is on the schedule?
What projects are coming up?
Then think about my workouts
Am I pushing hard enough?

Met some cool people today
Hope my impression was good
Had some fun conversations 
Talked to a couple cute girls 

Thinking about all these things 
Then I think about the world 
And I really want to sleep 
But my mind just won’t let me
