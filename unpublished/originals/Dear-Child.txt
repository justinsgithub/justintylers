Dear Child

Dear child, I love you 
I have been very careful
That I don’t meet you 

Cautious with women 
Protection from accident 
I can’t be careless 

Dear child I’m sorry 
Have not met your mother yet 
Haven’t been looking 

Have been too afraid 
Bring you into this cruel world 
How could I do that 

I love you too much 
Let you suffer like I have?
Isn’t that selfish? 

Have sex carelessly 
This I’m careful not to do 
I protect my seed 

I’m protecting you 
I am not worthy of you 
Of being your dad 

I’m not confident 
I can be so insecure 
Nothing like my dad 

But that’s the old me 
And I finally see myself 
Holding you one day 

I’ve grown up a bit 
Dropped all of my bad habits 
Stopped chasing woman 

Waiting on your mom 
Now the man I’ve been trying 
To be for so long 

To hold you one day 
Would be my greatest blessing 
I will be ready 

Dear child forgive me 
For not bringing you sooner 
I love you too much 

To be too careless 
I don’t know when you’ll get here 
If you ever will 

But if that day comes 
Intent, purposeful, all love 
Dear child you’ll be light 

In a world so dark 
I will teach you best I can 
To love and not hate 

But God before me 
He’ll teach you to love yourself 
My love’s not enough 

Raise you to be strong 
Just like my dad did for me 
Pass on all the love 

Unconditional 
Just like my family’s shown me 
They want to meet you 

Maybe more than me 
Until that day comes and if 
I’ll be preparing 

To be the wisest 
Most loving and best teaching 
Best dad I could be
