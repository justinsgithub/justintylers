Sober

She wants me sober 
I looked her dead in the eyes 
This would be over 

She asks what I mean 
She doesn’t know me sober 
She knows a fun mask 

Pills, powders, liquids 
Keep me calm as I waste time 
Vices relax me 

Substances chill me 
They let me waste time with her 
While time slips away 

Drugs let me forget 
That the world is on fire 
That life is in pain 

That love is losing 
And hate seems to be winning 
Our country needs help 

She thinks I’m too high 
When we met I was too drunk
Not ever sober 

Pills stashed within reach 
Hard liquor stocked in the fridge 
Powder always crushed 

Honest I told her 
You will be gone in a week 
You are far too weak 

Can’t keep up with me 
Crazier when I’m sober 
I don’t stop moving 

I don’t stop thinking 
I don’t let myself sit still 
While the world feels pain

I feel it as well
I cannot just do nothing 
I must try to help 

She says she can too 
I say okay let’s see it 
It takes sacrifice 

To change, we must trade
Stop flaunting all these fake clothes 
Knock off apparel 

No mindless movies
Instead read a mindful book 
No more new iPhones 

Start saving money 
To invest in our future 
Spend time on knowledge 

Drugs do include weed 
Will you let go of this vice? 
She says that she can’t 

Will you work more hours? 
She says no way I cannot 
“Full time is enough”

If you want world change 
You need to become that change 
And we then become more 

Without substances 
I will no longer be numb 
I will stand for change 

24/7 
I will make this change happen 
Because I have to 

Without substances 
I can’t ignore the worlds pain 
And give her the time 

I wish that I could 
She says she still wants to try 
So we tried our best 

My drive is unmatched 
And I cannot hold her hand 
I’m sorry, Goodbye 

She chose her vices 
Which do not go with my plans 
But she wanted this 

And so she’s gone now 
But I am back to myself 
Problems off the shelf 

I miss her like hell 
But I like the new me more 
For change I wage war 

Married to my work 
Committed to my studies 
This is me sober
