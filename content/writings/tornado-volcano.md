He’s a volcano 

She’s more like a tornado 

Such a beautiful disaster 

---

They knew from the start 

This thing should not even start 

But their loves a work of art 

---

Far from heaven sent 

This had to be a cruel joke 

A lesson sent from above 

---

How long could they last 

Before they killed each other 

Most stubborn headed pair 

---

The fights steadily grew 

She’s a hellish attitude 

His silver tongue could be so rude

---

They party all night 

Hustle like hell every day 

Could not keep up with this pace 

---

They light up any place 

They glow whenever they talk 

A storm wherever they walk 

---

The ship starts to sink 

They’re not jumping overboard 

The arguments started slow 

---

Their hearts start to sink 

Because they know that’s coming 

So they just try not to think 

---

Let the good times roll 

We’ll take our chance with the dice 

I’ve gotta have you tonight 

---

Don’t care about the price 

But with too many night spent 

The devil came for their debt 

---

They blinked, then shipwrecked 

His mouth just never shuts up 

Her arguments never end 

---

They kept on going 

Until all winnings were spent 

Tore their love island apart 

---

No sign of it left 

Light it on fire burn it up 

Blow all the remnants away 

---

Remnants of their love 

Still remain in the ocean 

Tornado, Volcano

Two souls that got hit with the deadliest love potion
