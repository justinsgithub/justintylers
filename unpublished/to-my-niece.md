To My Niece 
by Justin Tyler

Hey baby girl how you been? 
Sorry I haven’t been there 
I think about you every day 
Just wanted to say thank you 

You are so funny and strong 
Best frenemy forever 
My favorite dodgeball games 
That I’ll never let you win 

You really taught me so much 
You were the size of my hands 
Crazy how you’ve grown so much 
I know that you can’t read this 

But in case one day you do 
Say hi to your bro for me 
You’ll be such a great sister 
You’re so protective and strong 

Don’t let these girls break his heart 
And don’t let those boys break yours 
I know you’re too smart for that 
You’re so beautiful and strong 

You get it from your mama
You’re so lucky to have her 
She’s done an amazing job 
Almost the youngest sibling 

More grown up than all of us 
Puts you before everything 
Sacrifices her whole life 
Couldn’t be more proud of her

Hope you know to respect her 
She does everything for you 
Such an amazing mother 
Really hope you know that too 

Don’t let this world get to you 
Always hold your head up high 
And never get too lonely 
I’m always here to say hi 

Don’t get too hard on yourself 
I know you already do 
Please don’t cry over spilled milk 
Really hope you learn that soon 

You taught me so many things
To give better attention 
For even just five minutes 
Sometimes all that was needed 

You would have me ice your knee 
Not sure there was pain at all 
Still so happy to do it 
In 5 minutes the pains gone 

I’m trying to be better 
A good role model for you 
But if I never get there 
Just know how much I love you
