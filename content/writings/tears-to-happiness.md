title: Tears To Happiness 
---

My mother left me 

She left a note on the bed 

My dads tears join it 

---

My dog just got hit 

I cut off feelings for pets 

It is too much pain 

---

Now another divorce 

My second mom left the state 

I miss the family 

--- 

Dad asks why I cry 

I ask myself the same thing 

I cry and wonder 

---

Got my first girlfriend 

To scared to take on a date 

Fear killed a lifetime 

---

“Yeah, that one fat kid”

I was standing right behind them 

Thanks a lot cool kids 

---

My dad is real tired 

He fell asleep in a chair 

Needle in his arm 

---

My dad went to jail 

And our house burnt to the ground 

My dad is not well 

---

My grandparents left 

They helped raise me as their own

They have left the state 

---

My best friend is gone 

Said goodbye with a shotgun 

I scream all alone 

---

Alcohol problem 

Too much drugs in my system 

My soul is burning 

---

Another break up 

Because I must be broken

She cannot fix me 

---

I’m barely alive 

I’m not even 25 

I’ve written nothing 

---

But Mother came back 

Rescued us when dad was sick 

She helped save my life 

---

Pets are a blessing 

I can’t wait to see you Blue

Have fun with Riley 

---

Got a second mom 

Three more amazing siblings 

She helped save my life 

---

I cry in wonder 

I wonder how it could be 

I got so lucky 

---

Lucky with women

More gorgeous than any view 

Sunrise and sunset 

---

And now those kids wish 

They had my body and car 

I wish them the best 

---

My very best friend 

My foundation and hero 

My dad is awake 

---

My dad fought through hell

He chose for a better life 

I will do the same 

---

I have fought through hell 

My grandparents led the way 

My superheroes 

---

My best friend found peace 

World’s best guardian angel

See you in due time  

---

Alcohols disgusting 

Drugs do nothing for me now 

No more ephedrine 

---

Rather love and lose 

I am no longer broken 

No one to compare 

---

I’m just now alive 

I have just turned 25 

I’m writing it all 

---

Tears To Happiness  

We can write a new novel 

Whenever we choose
