Validation

Just validation 
Thinking I was her true love 
But nah, I was just 

Her validation 
A boost for her confidence 
Never let me go 

Justifications 
Saying she loved me too much 
Now I see the truth 

Needs a replacement 
Before she’ll set me free 
She plays other guys 

Has me on a hook 
She pleads baby please don’t leave 
No replacement yet 

She’s down on her knees 
I tried so hard to leave you 
You begged me to stay 

Way too many times
Couldn’t say no to those eyes 
Then you found that guy 

Wow, same name as me 
Isn’t that just so perfect 
Time to kick me out 

Found our last heartbreak
I never hear from her now 
Not a, “how you been?”

No, “hope you been good”
Hope your new validation 
Treats you way better 

Than I ever could 
Hope he never sees the truth 
Never leaves you blue 

Cause I still love you 
I just couldn’t be that guy 
Your validation 

The lust of your life 
Admit I still feel a fool 
Broke all my own rules 

I guess love and lose 
Better than no things to do 
But breaking your heart 

Would break mine x2 
And now you’re over it 
I just should’ve known 

Sex, lust, sure not love 
Just your only addiction 
But your sober now
