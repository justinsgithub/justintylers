Quitting Anabolic Steroids

I injected anabolic steroids from February 2016 to June 2020.

This is my experience about quitting them.

I started using crystal meth in 2019. 

It became a bandaid for my life problems, stress, anxiety, and ptsd from childhood that I hadn’t worked through yet. 

Meth began replacing everything in my life, including other drugs, alcohol, friends, girl friends, and family.

Towards the end of my meth use I decided to quit taking anabolic steroids.

My life was spiraling downhill and part of my problems, drama, stress, and pain was coming from sleeping around with my ex girlfriends.

I was willing to do anything to get out of the circumstances I was in so I decided to quit injecting any anabolic steroids.

My thought process was to completely kill my sex drive so that I was not inclined to sleep around anymore.

I was a complete wreck with no hormones in me and would take more crystal meth to make up for my lack of energy and down moods. 

About 1-2 months after quitting the steroids I quit meth as well.

I didn’t really notice the negative effects from coming off the steroids too much as my mind was preoccupied recovering from the meth.

I gained about 30 pounds of fat and water from August 2020 - December 2020.

I noticed but did not care too much and felt extremely weak when I would try working out here and there.

My sex drive was pretty nonexistent during this time as well.

My body started recovering December 2020.

I very slowly started doing very light workouts the very beginning of December.

I also slowly changed my eating habits into only non-processed, whole food.

Now at the end of January 2021 my body has gained some shape again, my sex drive feels healthy, and my cardiovascular system might be the healthiest it’s been in my entire life.

My resting heart rate would never get below 90 bpm the past few years and now is in the 60s.

My body fat is slowly decreasing and strength is steadily increasing.

I am being very careful with my mind and body and seeing natural progression again feels amazing.

Looking back, and observing guys on steroids at the gym now it just seems like the silliest thing to do. 

Steroids only exaggerate your natural body, often with superficial looks that are kinda gross and with possibly permanent damaging side-effects.

In reality steroids will not make your life any better, no one will see you any different, or respect you any more.

Any positives you think steroids might give you are completely in your head and just not realistic.

The boost in self image / confidence is only due to anabolic steroids effects with dopamine on the brain and temporary.

The risk of potentially permanent side effects such as liver failure, kidney failure, and hair-loss, far outweigh the temporary superficial boost in false confidence and toxic ego.

Using testosterone to aid sexual performance or normal body composition is a terrible band aid to hide underlying health concerns that need to be addressed.

As my dad always taught me, taking shortcuts or the easy path in life will always lead to long term failure and never be prosperous.

I do have an impressively hard head and for some reason I insist on learning things the hard way.
