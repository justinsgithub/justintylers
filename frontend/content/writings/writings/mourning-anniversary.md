Happy anniversary 
Passed away 5 years ago today 
On my way to work this morning 
Feeling like it was yesterday 
<!--more-->

Sat in the car the other day 
And then that one song played 
Wish you would step back from that ledge my friend 

First time I’ve spent January 12th sober 
Usually preparing for the worst hangover 
But I’m feeling better now 
Trying to learn from the past 
Look at all the wrong I’ve done 
Accept the things I cannot change 

Never though I’d get over it 
Miss seeing you walk in the gym 
With one of your silly walks
Lost passion in my workouts 
Health and fitness got so pointless
Missed the times we’d just sit and talk 
Talk about life and what was wrong 
The things we want to change 
Admit our insecurities 
I wanted to look just like you 
You wanted to be just like me 

Ambitious competitors 
With vicious but calm tempers  
Almost killed each other sometimes 
But always had each others back
Backed me up when I trash talk too much 
But I’ve grown up a little bit
Lost all of my anger
Now I only compete with myself
Hoping that you’re watching still 

I’ve lived a lot since you left 
Coping with the fact of death 
A lot of good, a lot of bad 
Felt so sad, angry, and lost 
Mad at myself, the world, and you 
How could I have let this happen?
Why was the world so cruel to you?
How could you just leave me here?

But I’ve learned a lot since then 
I’ve seen God since then 
Wish you would have too 
But I guess you know him now 
And know how much God loves you 
I wish God was not so misunderstood, so misinterpreted

Everybody loved you 
So many people at your memorial 
So many that you made happy 
That’s all you wanted to do 
So sad they didn’t make you happy too 
I felt the same pain as you 
So thankful I got through it 
Big part of that is thanks to you 

Spent your last weekend here together 
Partying in the city
Got too trashed to remember 

But remember you on that ledge 
Looking down sitting off the edge 
I just didn’t know what to say 
Couldn’t say it will all be okay 
But still stood right behind you
Heart racing ready to grab you 

Shoe hanging off your foot 
As you stared down and asked 
“What if I just fell?”
I just don’t know what to say 
“come back inside,  girls are waiting”
Eventually you came back inside 
But I’m still anxious as hell 
Heart feeling broken in twelve
My heart was completely shattered 

We made it through the weekend 
Things might get better this week 
But depressions got you so weak
Please just make it to Wednesday 
Things won’t be as bad as they seem
Then Monday came 

Asked me to hang one more night 
My last chance to save your life 
But I didn’t know that then 
I’m still dead hungover and exhausted
I’m sorry I just can’t do it 
You begged me but I wouldn’t budge 
Didn’t know you were saying goodbye 
That we were speaking for the last time
Never got to say goodnight 
And you went to sleep forever 

I miss you bro, I love you 
Wish I told you that more
Couldn’t have told you enough 
Not blaming myself was tough 
Tried not to think about it 
If there was something I could’ve done 
To save you from that fucking gun

Growing up was hard for us 
Family problems hurt our mental 
But I’m over all that now 
And I’m ready to make you proud 

I’ll continue doing what you loved 
Help others never feel like us 
That’s my biggest goal in life now 
To always spread kindness and love 
Maybe save someone from that gun
Let them know they’re not alone 
That they’re perfect in ways of their own 

I know you’re in a better place 
Can’t wait to see you there one day 
I’m truly at peace and happy now
Thankful for the time we got 
Until I see you again 
I’ll be missin you a lot 
You’ll always inspire me
