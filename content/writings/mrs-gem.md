Sorry Mrs. Gem 

And Mr. Gem as well 

I fell far too quick 

---

I don’t know how I 

Caught your daughters eye 

She always had mine 

---

Didn’t expect it 

Didn’t think I had a chance 

I wasn’t prepared 

---

I pursued too fast 

Once I saw I had a chance 

And I did not see 

---

Much more than skin deep 

But then I saw in her eyes

Beauty and wonder 

---

Left me paralyzed 

And I just got so damn scared 

She was so much more 

---

More than I could give 

I had to self sabotage 

She deserves much more 

---

Surely I cannot 

Tell her I’m sorry Mrs. Gem 

Miss her every day

---

Just wasn’t ready

Everyday I work to be 

A man that’s worthy 

---

So far every time 

I think I find myself a real dime

She ends up diamond 

---

One day I’ll get there 

I’ll be the man she deserves 

Better every day 

---

I hope her new man 

Treats her nothing less than that 

The diamond she is 

---

Or he might deal with 

Mr. Gem’s gun and mine 

Sorry Mrs. Gem
