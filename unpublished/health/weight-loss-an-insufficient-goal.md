Weight Loss, An Insufficient Goal

Many times I have heard friends, family, or gym members state their goal in the gym "I want to lose weight". 

When I ask them why they usually give the same answers. They want to be better looking, or more self confidence, or because their doctor or family member said they should.

These are reasons that often stem from insecurities, self hate, and criticism. These are very poor motivators and often Insufficient fuel for getting us to our goals.

I encourage anybody to really take time, sit down and write down ones goals. Ask yourself deeper questions about why you want to lose weight. Weight loss is just 1 way to temporarily track the progress we are making towards better health, longevity, self-awareness, and self-love. 

The real goals behind losing weight might be: 
- to fit in our old clothes
- feel comfortable at the beach
- to feel good 
- to have the ability to play a lot with our great grandkids 
- to stay out of a wheel chair when we are old
- more energy to perform better at work 
- because working out feels good 
- to live life to the fullest 

Focusing on the scale is also a very Insufficient way of tracking progress. We may go through phases where we are building strength so our weight stays the same. Or maybe we add some muscle to desired body parts at the same time we lose fat, so the scale doesn't move much. 

Sometimes our bodies will retain more water while we are losing fat and we may go weeks without the scale moving or looking different in the mirror. 

For seeing our results better we can focus on other markers, such as:

- how far we can go on different cardio machines in a set amount of time 
- how many minutes we can last on different cardio machines 
- our resting heart rate 
- the amount of weight we are lifting 
- do a fitness test once a month to see how far you can bike, run, or row in 15 minutes 
- test how much weight you can lift for 3 sets of 8

Set goals on improving the weight you can lift and the distance or time you can do cardio.

As these other markers improve (which can happen fairly quickly) your body composition will naturally improve and feel much better. 

Before you know it, you'll begin seeing results and see that you are lifting more and biking further. 
You'll also realize that you are fitting into your clothes better, and are more energized and in better moods. 
For the best fitness results you don't even need to step on a scale. 

Instead of "I want to lose weight", 
maybe try 
"I want to be the best me possible. 
I want to feel as good as possible for myself and my family. 
I want the best energy and mood possible to excel at my career, hobbies, and make the most of life."
