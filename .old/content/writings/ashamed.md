How did I fail this bad?

Should have learned from my dad 

Feeling so embarrassed 

I didn’t mean to fall 

---

Felt up against a wall 

Like a felt like a crisis 

Looking like such a mess 

Just broke another heart 

I also shattered mine



---

So gone off the alcohol 

That’s when she came to me 

I’m too lit to say no 

Another fucking heartbreak 

What a perfect excuse 



---

Just didn’t realize 

What I was saying yes to 

It was coming from a friend 

It can’t be that bad for me 



---

Just want this pain to end 

But I’m not addicted 

Just do it every day 

I’ll quit when I want to 

But I never want to 



---

It takes the pain away 

It helps me not to think 

Throw away my morals 

Do what’s not good for me 

I don’t care about my health 

Give it to someone else 



---

I slowly lost myself 

In others around me 

Give everything to them 

While I’m slowly drowning 



---

Toxic relationships 

That I can’t get out of 

Substance made me weak 

Can’t stand up for myself 

Justify decisions 



---

I walked out on my job 

They said I needed help 

And I said thanks but no thanks 

I’ll just find somewhere else 



---

I went and found a new job 

Don’t see the problem now 

Look at all my money 

These drugs just help me out 



---

You see unlike people 

My drugs don’t let me down

Always late to work now

Awkward conversations 

My new bosses don’t care 

Still putting numbers up 



---

I think I’ll be just fine 

Slowly losing my mind 

Reality is showing 

Embarrassed and ashamed 



---

Don’t know what to do 

Too guilty to ask for help

Messed up too many times 

Two trips to the ER 

Grandparents worried sick 



---

How could I do this again? 

Guilty, embarrassed, ashamed 

Letting everyone down 

Felt no desire to live 

Felt I don’t deserve it 



---

But I’m all better now 

Mental still recovering 

Thanks to my family 

Refuse to fall again 

A promise I won’t break 



---

Love life more than ever 

Finally myself again 

From the depths of my soul 

From the bottom of my heart 

Thank You
