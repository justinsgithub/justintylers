title: Airport Detox
---

I'm visiting my family for the holidays
Taking a flight out of state
Debated taking my drugs with me
That might lead to a bad fate
I better let them stay
<!--more-->

I almost missed the flight
Partied with my girl all night
Didn't want leave her at home
Sad thoughts circling round the dome
I feel the break up coming soon 
She can hear it in my tone

Cold sweats at the airport
My skin is tingling now
Feel people staring at me
Face is sunken in 
I should probably eat something
It's been quite a minute

I wonder just how bad I look
Swear people are looking at me
Maybe i'm just being paranoid 
Maybe they're talking about me
Wondering what's wrong with me
I try to look happy
Look like i've been through hell
Mood has never been so crappy

Go to the bathroom mirror
Now i'm in disbelief 
Never thought this could happen 
Don't even recognize myself 
I really need to eat 
My body's feeling so weak
Passed out for the entire flight
I just don't want to feel or think

Grab alcohol as soon as I land
A bandaid for the withdrawals
Feel like I forgot everything
Going through my phone 
Trying to remember me 
My girl is trippin out
Says she's dying missing me

But I feel so dead inside 
Me and her don't coincide 
Never sober when i'm with her
Never sober period
Being sober sucks
Whiskey the whole visit home

Alcohol to kill my thoughts
A little more to kill my feelings
Now I feel fat and bloated
My muscles wasting away
I've got a problem, duly noted
Can't even stand to see myself

This detox didn't work at all
Ruined it with alcohol 
Soon as I get back I order up a ball
Give my supplier a call
Don't care what it's mixed with
Don't even ask

Cold sweats, cold thoughts, cold feelings
But these lines keep me warm
Sorry to my family, maybe I should've warned
I'm just not myself these days
But I don't tell anyone
Keep my problems secret
No one to relieve it 
Maybe next year I'll do better
