Blood sugar is a something that is important for everybody to have a general knowledge and understanding of.

With no awareness of blood sugar it can have negative effects on your health over time if not kept in check.

Here are keypoints about blood sugar and how the foods we eat effect it;

Overview 
    - Blood sugar is also known as blood glucose and comes from the food we eat
    - Our bodies create blood sugar by digesting food into a sugar that goes into our bloodstream 
    - Our body uses blood sugar for energy, excess sugar gets stored in cells for later use
    - Type 2 diabetes is a disease identified as having higher levels of blood sugar than what's within normal limits
    - Diabetes can lead to problems with the heart, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels
    - Knowing about how different foods effect blood sugar can protect you against diabetes or help you manage it if you already have diabetes 

How eating works
    - Our bodies break down everything we eat into specific nutrients during digestion
    - These nutrients include macronutrients carbohydrates, fats, proteins
    - These nutrients also include micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals
    - Our body transports these nutrients throughout the body to the places they need to go 
    
Carbohydrates
    - The carbs we eat turn into blood sugar.
    - The more carbs we eat, the higher levels of sugar we get released as we digest and absorb the nutrients in our food 
    - Fiber is one part of carbouhydrates that is not converted into sugar, since it can't be digested
    - Proteins, fats, water, vitamins, and minerals do not have carbohydrates
    - Carbohydrates have the greatest effect on blood glucose levels
    - Especially dealing with diabetes, carbohydrates are the most important part of the diet to consider when it comes to your blood sugar levels

High Carb foods
    - Foods are generally grouped into the category of being a protein, carb, or fat, although they usually have a mixture of the 3
    - Foods that cause the biggest raise in our blood sugar are foods high in processed carbohydrates, or processed sugars
    - If watching carbohydrate be wary how many of these foods you intake, use smaller portions and choose whole grain options
    
Some common highly processed carbohydrate foods (non-extensive); 
    - white grain foods (pasta and rice)
    - pizza
    - cookies
    - white bread
    - cereals
    - sugary drinks (gatorade, soda, juice)

Insulin
    - Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels
    - Your pancreas makes insulin
    - Insulin controls blood sugar levels by assisting cells that absorb sugar from the bloodstream
    - Type 1 diabetes is when your body does not make insulin, so you have to inject insulin every day
    - Type 2 diabetes can be managed with diet and exercise but sometimes medications are resorted to as well 
    - With type 2 diabetes your body produces insulin but doesn't use it properly, or doesn't produce enough of it 
    - With type 2 diabetes your cells don't respond to insulin, so more sugar keeps circulating in the blood 
    - Exercise helps cells respond better and be more sensitive to insulin
    - The proper diet helps keep your pancreas healthy and functioning well since high blood sugar levels decrease pancreatic function 
    
Healthy eating habits 
    - Eating balanced, mixed meals helps defend against big blood sugar spikes
    - Including proteins, fats, and high-fiber foods in every meal help slow the digestion of carbs, and therefore a more steady release of sugar into the blood stream, with a lesser spike of blood sugar
    - Eating more often is helpful as well, several small meals instead of a couple big meals, so less carbs are getting digested all at once
    - Eating at least a small snack every 2 - 4 hours is good practice for stable blood sugar levels 

Exercise
    - Exercise effects blood sugar since blood sugar is used for energy
    - When you do any kind of strenous movement  your cells absorb sugar from the blood to use for energy 
    - Depending on the intensity and length of exercise, your blood sugar can lower for many hours after stopping movement
    - regular exercise makes your cells more sensitive to insulin, which helps keep blood sugar levels in normal ranges
    
End note 
    - Carbs are the macronutrient that affects blood sugar the most. 
    - Carbs are not the only macronutrient that give you calories, you also have fats and proteins (and alcohol)
    - Eating more calories than your body burns every day adds small bits of fat storage, which add up over time
    - The more weight you gain, the more insensitive to insulin you get
    - The less sensitive to insulin you are, the more your blood sugar levels can rise
    - Avoid or minimize your consumption of sweet foods and drinks, as well as any processed foods
    - In general, the closer the food is to it's natural state the better
    - Smarter carb and sugar choices such as fruit over candy are important
    - A cookie and apple might have the same amount of carbs, but fruit also has fiber, vitamins, and minerals that your body needs to thrive
