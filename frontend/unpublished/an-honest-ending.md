# An Honest Ending

## congratulations, over a year of sobriety 
> an untruthful statement

Wrecklessly going from 0 - 100 with absolutely no direction or real goals in mind is where i found myself, once again, at the beginning of 2021. Sometime mid 2021 I was rehired at previous job for an awesome company. I fell right back into the same habit of trying to be productive every second of the day and exhausting my mind and body to the point of relapse.

My future once again seemed bleak with a passionless career. A career that I would still have to bust my ass at least 60 hours a week to make a satisfying living but a bland lifestyle. A mediocre / boring lifestyle is something I have always known I would never settle for. Luckily I did know a solution to add some form of stimulation to anything bland.

## welcome to my relapse
> well hello again, Crystal 

Feeling carefree, careless, high not on life, I took some time off work. I came up with the idea that I should put some focus into learning tech again and see if I could make any progress, which i had failed to do much of the previous 6 months.

Somehow in my high speed state of mind I was able to piece together a program that actually did some automation with Tinder and Instagram. This was a huge success relative to any of my previous tech activities and I started "tweaking out" on coding. I developed a third program that actually started to bring in a tiny amount of income so I was off the walls about it.

Thinking back it's actually amazing I was able to do piece together any sort of program. I had a severe lack of fundamental knowledge in even the most basic computer science or software development fields. Of course the progress I made only lasted a couple weeks (maybe). Crystal meth may boost your mental performance for a day or two and then your brain hits overload and just starts frying from there. The brain cannot actually process any new input enough to analyze It while on drugs so learning anything new is severely stunted.

## a brief overview of events
> while back on drugs

The worst thing that I did was also the best thing that happened to me. I started a relationship while hiding the fact that I had fallen back into a hard drug addiction. Eventually I came clean to her and she helped me reach sobriety again. I am forever grateful for her and words cannot do her justice.

In my lost and lifted state I honestly believed that after 2 MONTHS of obsessively writing terrible code without any real knowledge of how half of it was working I thought I was ready for a job writing software professionally. I thought every line I wrote was brilliant and that I was a genius ( I might still think i'm genius ðŸ˜‰ ). This led to me qutting an awesome job way too early, thinking that I could get by long enough to land a job in the industry. This was completely delusional. Now I am most likely going to have to get a mediocre job to get by until I am actually able to land a career as a software developer, so I really screwed myself there.

Luckily I was able to maintain some level of functionality and damage control so i didn't go messing up anything in my life and overall, a ton of positives and amazing oppurtunities came out of 2021. I had a small amount of drugs left at the beginning of November that i proudly threw away. However my last use was  (unintentionally) end of November when I was offered Crystal while visiting a friend ( she seems to just pop up out of nowhere too often ). I didn't think too much of it and figured why not, which just served as a good reminder to stay away from it.

## going forward
> just over 1 month sober 

I think I've learned my lessons this time and I don't think making the right choices will be as much of a struggle at this point. I am still being extremely cautious with my self and my interactions which are pretty much limited to my girlfriend, grandparents, and the computer. I have finally found the path to success that I have been hoping for my entire life. 

Up to 6 months ago, anyone who's ever known me would have laughed if I said I was pursuing a career in tech ( myself included ). In 2020 I would joke about being computer illiteral with the minimal usage I had for them in sales. Finding a career I can be passionate about and not having to slave away at lame jobs with no mental stimulation has been the coolest thing. I hope everyone finds something in life that makes getting up in the morning easy.

It's been an incredible life up to this point and there is nothing I would ever trade it for. 

Happy New Years everyone, much love and thanks for all the positive energy and support.
