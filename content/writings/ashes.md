Only in our late teens

Noticed you in class 

Way too beautiful for me 

Tried to talk to you 



---

You mentioned your man 

A girl I could never have 

Secret crush on you 



---

Such forbidden fruit 

I was friends with your family 

They said don’t you dare 



---

Then a year passed by 

Rumors that your single now 

I couldn’t resist 



---

I took my shot quick 

The fireworks started big

Lit my heart on fire 



---

Too fast to stop it 

And the love just kept burning

A passion so bright 



---

But we were too young 

The timing just wasn’t right 

Timekeepers coming 



---

Says we’ve had our time 

We need to go live our lives 

We fought so damn hard 



---

We tried and tried 

But time kept watering us down 

The flames slowly died



---

Seven years later 

We stay warm by the embers 

But eventually 



---

Those embers die out 

Now I sit here all alone 

Writing this dumb poem 



---

Tears thinking of you 

I just hope that you’re alright 

Held on selfishly 



---

Inside of a jar

Keep the ashes of our love 

Forever in my heart
