There are a lot of rumors debating if soy is okay to eat, especially for men due to it having possible feminizing effects in the body
As with most everything in health, moderation is key, 1-4 servings a day at most might be recommended 

Here are key points science shows about  soy;

Contains various nutrients
    - Naturally rich in protein and contain all the essential amino acids your body needs
    - Rich in plant fats, fiber, and several important vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds
    - Natural source of polyphenols (a type of antioxidant that helps protect your body against cell damage and conditions like heart disease)
    
    - Rich in isoflavones ( a subclass of polyphenols reffered to as phytoestrogens due to their ability to attach to and activate estrogen receptors in your body )
    - Soy Isoflavones are believed to be one of the main reasons behind the many purported health benefits of soy-based foods.
    - Due to similarity in structure soy isoflavones are often believed to mimic the hormone estrogen, however research shows soy isoflavones differ from estrogen in many ways, with each having unique effects on the human body
        
Help lower cholesterol levels
    - Studies show diets including soy foods help lower low-density lipoproteins (LDL, bad cholesterol) and raise high-density lipoproteins (HDL, good cholesterol)
    - Reviews shows an average intake of 25 grams / day of soy protein reduces total LDL (bad cholesterol) by around 3%
    - Reviews show soy-rich diets help raise HDL (good cholesterol) by 3%
    - Reviews show soy-rich diets reduce triglyceride levels by around 4%
    - Minimally processed soy foods such as soybeans, tofu, tempeh, and edamame, appear to improve cholesterol levels more than processed soy products and supplements
    
Protect heart health
    - Soy isoflavones may help reduce inflammation in blood vessels and improve their elasticity - two factors that protect the health of your heart
    - Reviews show soy-rich diets having a 10-20% lower risk of stroke and heart disease as opposed to the average Americans diet
    - Research shows diets including soy foods can reduce your risk of dying from heart disease by up to 15%

Lower blood pressure
    - Soybeans and foods made from them are generally rich in arginine (an amino acid that helps regulate blood presssure levels)
    - Soybeans are also rich in isoflavones, a compound with blood-pressure-lowering benefits
    - Studies show eating 1/2 cup of soy nuts daily was found to reduce diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood reading) by around 8% 
    - Studies show daily intakes of 65-153 mg of soy isoflavones having blood pressure reductions of 3 - 6 mm Hg 
    
Improve fertility
    - Studies show women with high intakes of soy isoflavones were 1.3-1.8 times more likely to give birth following fertility treatments than those with lower soy isoflavone intakes
    - Studies show soy foods were found to offer some protection against the effects of bisphenol A, (BPA) a compound found in some plastics believed to reduce fertility
    - Studies show there may be less helpful effects on fertility if too much isoflavones is consumed per day, under 50 mg is shown to be the safe zone (1-2 servings per day)

Lower blood sugar
    - Reviews show soy isoflavones help reduce blood sugar and isulin levels in menopausal women
    - Soy isoflavones help lower insulin resistance (a condition in which cells no longer respond to insulin normally) (over time, insulin resistance can result in high blood sugar levels and lead to type 2 diabetes)

Reduce menopause symptoms
    - Soy is rich in isoflavones, (a class of compounds referred to as phytoestrogens, or plant estrogens, due to their ability to bing to estrogen receptors in the body)
    - During menopause, a woman's estrogen levels naturally decrease, resulting in unpleasant symptoms, such a fatigue, vaginal dryness, and hot flashes 
    -  By binding to estrogen receptors in the body, soy isoflavones are believed to help somewhat reduce the severity of these symptoms
    -  Research shows isoflavones help reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes 
    -  Soy isoflavones also appear to help relieve the fatigue, joint pain, depression, irritability, anxiety, and vaginal dryness experienced during menopause and/or the years leading up to it
    
Improve bone health 
    - Low estrogen levels experienced during menopause may cause calcium to leach from the bones
    - The resulting bone loss may cause post menopausal woman to develop weak and brittle bones (a condition known as osteoporosis)
    - Evidence shows intakes of 40 - 110 mg of soy isoflavones per day can may reduce bone loss and improve markers of bone health in menopausal women (the equivalent of eating around 5 - 15.5 ounces of tofu or 1/3 - 1 cup of cooked soybeans each day)
    
Reduce the risk of breast cancer
    - Diets rich in soy have been shown to lower risk of certain cancers
    - Reviews show woman with high soy intakes prior to receiving a cancer diagnosis may be at 16% lower risk of dying from the condition, compared with those with low intakes
    - High soy intakes pre- and post-diagnoses may also reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women by up to 28% 
    - Studies show that both pre- and postmenopausal women eating soy-rich diets may benefit from a 27% lower risk of cancer

Reduce the risk of other types of cancer
    - Studies show that high intakes of soy isoflavones may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by around 19%
    - Studies show that high intakes of soy flavones may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by around 19%
    - Studies have linked soy-rich diets to a 7% lower risk of digestive tract cancers and an 8 - 12% lower risk of colon and colorectal cancers
    - Studies show men eating diets including soy may benefit from a lower risk for prostate cnacer
    - Reviews show diets rich in soy foods can lead to a 12% lower risk of dying from cancer, particularly cancers of the stomach, large intestine, and lungs    

Metabolic syndrome
Evidence shows that soy protein supplements help lower blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, which refers to multiple conditions including
    - high blood sugar 
    - high cholesterol levels
    - high blood pressure
    - abdominal fat
    - together these increase a person's risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke
    
List of the nutrients found in popular soy products

    - Iron
    - Magnesium
    - Phosphorus
    - Potassium

    - Riboflavin
    - Vitamin B6
    - Folate

There are people and articles that cause concern around eating soy products, some clarification on these concerns;

Estrogen-like effects
    - Soy isoflavones are often thought to copy the female reproductive hormone estrogen, they are similiar in structure to this hormone, however soy isoflavones have weaker and slightly different effects than estrogen 

Cancer risk
    - Some believe soy isoflavones may raise risk of breast or endometrial cancer, studies find no negative effect, and show they may offer some protection against certain cancers
    
Thyroid function 
    - Test-tube and animal studies sugges that some compounds may reduce thyroid gland function. Human studies find little to no negative efffects
    
Feminizing effect in men
    - Some worry soy isoflavones may lower testosterone production, however studies do not support this theory

GMOs 
    - Soybeans are often genetically modified. GMOs contain fewer nutrients and more herbicide residue than their organic counterparts
    
    - Concerns with soy are common but few are supported by solid science 
    - Negative effects were also reported when consuming mass amounts of soy, such as up to 9x the recommended intake
