title: Quit Work 
---

I truly try my hardest 

Do my best job every day 

To make work a happy place 

Most days it seems to workout 

---

Love to see everyone smile 

Get the stress out of their head 

But sometimes my efforts fail 

Somebody quit work today 

---

I could see it from the start 

They just had no confidence 

Was I nice enough to him 

Maybe would’ve made him stay 

---

I just started here as well 

But I just cannot help it 

Feeling I’m responsible 

Like what more could I have done?

---

Feeling it’s partly my fault 

I’ve felt this way my whole life 

So used to taking the blame 

Admit all of my own faults 

---

I suppose I’ll take yours too 

Somebody quit work today 

Said it was just too fast paced 

Started the same day as me 

---

Was there something I could do? 

Anything I could’ve said?

Maybe make your days better 

So you wouldn’t want to leave 

---

Obviously silly thoughts 

And it’s clearly not my fault 

Nothing to do with my job 

I am just a coworker 

---

Don’t know why I can’t help it 

Hold myself responsible 

For the things not in my hands 

For the things I can’t control 

---

It’s a blessing and a curse 

These responsibilities 

That I just can’t help but feel 

Yeah someone quit workout today 

---

So I’ll try better next time
