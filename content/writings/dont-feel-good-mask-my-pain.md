title: Don’t Feel Good, Mask My Pain
---


I do not feel good 

But how could anyone tell 

I hide it so well

---

A smile on my face 

A happy tone in my voice 

I compliment you 

---

But do not feel good

I have anxiety bad 

But I’m used to it 

---

Had it forever 

I am used to the sickness 

My stomach upset 

---

For me it’s normal 

Faking a smile while I hurt 

Only God could tell 

---

I do not feel good 

Distract myself from sadness 

I try not to think 

---

I distract myself 

With books, work, others problems 

Others do not know 

---

I do not feel good 

They think I’m all fun and games 

But they just don’t know 

---

My mask is so real 

I worked on this mask for years 

Perfected my smile 

---

Make my laughs seem real 

But I am hurting inside 

Always over think 

---

Since I was a child 

But wish no one this pain 

Don’t want them to see 

---

How bad this pain is 

So I crafted this mask well 

So comfortable

---

It never comes off

Sometimes believe it myself 

I grew up like this 

---

Not feeling so good 

It’s natural hiding the pain 

So you don’t see it 

---

You just see a smile 

You just hear a compliment 

My obnoxious laugh 

---

Beautiful disguise 

The mask that I hide behind 

When I take it off 

---

Make sure I’m alone 

The world does not need to see 

This amount of pain 

---

I handle my own 

I’ve learned to manage it well

No medication 

---

I’ve found when I smile 

That others often smile back 

That is some relief 

---

When I work real hard 

It makes others real happy 

That makes me happy 

---

Lose myself learning 

A good distraction from my pain 

It distracts my mind 

---

Others happiness 

Is something I love to see 

And I do my best 

---

Check under their mask

Make sure they don’t feel like me 

Hope you feel better
