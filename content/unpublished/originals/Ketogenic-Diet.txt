The ketogenic diet is based on extremely low carbs, a high amount of fat, and a low - average amount of protein. 

It is used to treat epilepsy (a brain disorder that causes seizures)

The keto diet is also recommended to help other brain problems and burn fat as well

Here are some keypoints about the ketogenic diet;
    - The goal of keto is to keep your body burning fat as its main fuel source 
    - The diet requires less than 50 grams of carbs a day 
    - This highly limits food you can eat
    - Carbs are found in foods such as fruits, dairy products, milk, pasta, cheese, starchy vegetables, corn, pototatoes, pasta, cereal, breads
    - Normally we use the carbs from these foods as energy by breaking them down to glucose to supply our cells
    - When you limit carbs for 3 - 4 days, your body starts looking for alternative fuel sources and will start burning fat
    - With no carbs our bodies break down fats in our liver, producing ketones
    
    - Our body and brain can then easily use ketones for energy instead of glucose from carbs
    - Ketosis is a metabolic state where blood ketone levels rise above normal 
    - Some suggest that ketones can protect against migraines (headaches that cause severe throbbing or pulsing pain, usually on one side of the head)
    - Migraines also have symptoms like nasuea and sensitivity to light or sound
    - It's speculated ketones can restore brain excitability and energy metabolism to counteract brain inflammation 
    
    Keto and migraines
        - Research shows the keto diet beneficial for helping migraines
        - Studies from 1928 show 39% of people improved in migraine frequency and severity on the keto diet
        - Using the keto diet for migraines declined overtime due to the strictness of it and development of over-the-counter prescription medications for managing the condition instead 
        - In 2015 interest of keto showed again when a studies showed migraine frequency was significantly reduced in women who followed a low calorie diet for 1 month compared with a standard low calorie diet

    Side notes 
        - The ketogenic diet might be contraindicated for those with liver conditions such as pancreatitis, liver failure, and fat-metabolism-related disorders 
        - Synthetic ketone supplements have been shown to increase blood ketone levels, but no studies have confirmed the same benefits as a true ketogenic diet
        - Always be way of any supplement, not found in it's natural form, supplements can have completely different or no effects on your health compared with it's true and natural form
