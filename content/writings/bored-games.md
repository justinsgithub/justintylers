title: Bored Games
---

It is the most frustrating game

Always wonder why I play

There's not even winners here

Never play it in the day

---

Then daylight ends and the darkness hits

I can feel it in my soul

Start to feel a little lonely 

My mood gets a little darker

I start feeling a little dull

---

Need something to feel stimulated

I just don't want to think

Maybe I'll lose myself in you 

After I have more than a couple drinks

---

Hit up the girls inside my phone

See who's down to play a game

But these games are never casual

Say they wanna have my baby

It turns into a dangerous thing

---

Get attached way too fast

But I won't lose a single day to them 

It's a vicious game we play

They try to cuff me down for the win

---

We're both bored and lonely

So I guess we'll play a game

But there are no winners here

And this game is getting lame 

---

Played it too many times before 

To be honest I'm getting bored

Always looking for more crazy

Need something more entertaining

No board games will entertain me

---

So far beyond attractive

But I don't stay attracted 

How long can you stay my main attraction?

Never long enough, I need more action 

---

I'm getting bored with these games

I think I'm moving on

I think I need something more

So i'm retiring from these games

---

No playing with girls anymore

Time for me to behave

No more tears, no more heartbreaks

I will not miss this game

---

There are no winners here

We all lose in the end 

I don't believe in fairytales

But I still need a better way to end
