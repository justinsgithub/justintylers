title: Her Validation
---

Just validation 
Thinking I was her true love 
But no, I was just her validation 
A boost for her confidence 
Never let me go 
<!--more-->

Beautiful justifications
Saying she just loved me too much 
Now I see the truth 

Needs a replacement before she’ll set me free 
She plays other guys while she has me on a hook 
She pleads baby please don’t leave 
No replacement yet 

I tried so hard to leave you 
You begged so hard for me to stay 
Down on her knees pleading

Tried leaving way too many times
Couldn’t say no to those eyes 
Then you found that other guy 

Same name as me
Isn’t that so perfect 
Time to kick me out 

Finally had our last heartbreak
it tastes so damn bittersweet
I never hear from you now 
Not a “how you been?”
No “hope you been good”
I truly hope you've found your peace

Hope your new validation treats you better 
Like I ever could 
Hope he never sees the truth 
Never leaves you blue 

I still love you
I just couldn’t be that guy 
Your validation 

The lust of your life 
Admit I still feel a fool 
Broke all of my own rules 

Love and lose, better than nothing to do 
But breaking your heart would break mine x2 
Now you’re over it 
I just wish I had known 

Sex, lust, sure not love 
Just your only addiction 
And your sober now
