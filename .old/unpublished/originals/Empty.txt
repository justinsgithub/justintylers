Empty 
by Justin Tyler

I’m sitting at my table 
My phone doesn’t ring these days 
Deleted all my contacts 

Keep all temptations away 
How am I supposed to feel? 
Spent 5 years on ups and downs

I just feel so empty now 
Fill up with conversations 
That all slowly fade away 

Try not to get negative 
But that’s all that surrounds me 
Everybody complaining 

Try not to let it down me 
My mental health in question 
Feel strangers all around me 

Feel better when I’m alone 
I just need some room to think 
These thoughts getting depressing

But let me turn them around 
I know I’m better than that 
Maybe empty isn’t bad

Maybe a chance to refill 
Fill up with new ideas 
Make a new dream become real 

Learn from my daily failures 
And do better tomorrow 
Still holding on to the past 

How do I let go of that 
It follows me everywhere 
Should I be okay with that?

Demons around the corner 
I can sense them everywhere 
But this time I’m not hiding

I’m standing tall and fighting 
Don’t need anyone’s support 
Don’t need gratification 

Don’t need to solve your problems 
And don’t need to help the world 
Just need to do what I can 

Just need to be what I am 
And right now I am empty 
And I think that’s quite alright 

There’s peace in the emptiness 
Serenity in the darkness 
Melody in the chaos 

Happiness in the sadness 
Good moments in the worst times 
Yeah I’m feeling so empty 
  
But everything will be alright
