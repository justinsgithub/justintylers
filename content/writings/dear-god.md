Writing this morning 

Just to say that I love you 

3:30 am

---

Best of me is you 

I did learn to love myself 

And all thanks to you 

---

I drowned in hate 

I never forgave myself 

You did that for me 

---

Jesus I thank you 

You took my pain as your own 

I don’t need meds now 

---

All of me is you 

If I ever stray tell me 

But please help me 

---

I still have problems 

I know you don’t mind helping 

God please how do I 

---

Help show this cruel world you 

How bad they really need you 

We’re killing ourselves 

---

My best friend left too 

Please show me how to show you 

Help save just one life 

---

I can’t save a life 

You taught me the hard way 

And I do thank you 

---

Despite the heartache 

I’ve failed trying to be you 

So God please help me

---

How today I might

Get them the chance to see you 

Let me example 

---

My success all you 

That’s it for now God, thank you 

Talk to you later
