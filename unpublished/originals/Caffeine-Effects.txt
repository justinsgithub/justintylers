Caffeine is a substance with potential side effects that everyone should be wary and knowledgable about before consuming.
The negative effects that caffeine may have on you include;

Anxiety
    - Caffeine is well known to increase alertness
    - It blocks the effects of adenosine(a brain chemical that makes you feel tired)
    - Triggers the release of adrenaline (the "fight or flight" hormone associated with increased energy)
    - These effects may lead to nervousness, jitterness, and similiar symptoms with even a modest intake
    - Modest doses have been shown to cause rapid breathing and increase stress levels when consumed in one sitting
    - Caffeine induced anxiety disorder is 1/4 caffeine-related syndromes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (which is published by the American Psychiatric Association)
    - One study in 25 healthy men found that those who got 300mg of caffeine (a large cup of starbucks coffee) experienced more than double the stress of those who took placebo
    - Stress levels are shown to be the same whether you drink caffeine products frequently or rarely, the body does not get used to the stress caffeine puts on it, although the energetic feeling may dull over time

Insomnia
    - Caffeine's ability to wake people or help them stay awake is what makes it so desirable
    - Sleep is our bodies defense against sickness and disease and is when the body repairs itself 
    - Caffeine can make it difficult to get enough restorative sleep for the body's systems
    - Studies show higher caffeine intake increases the amount of time it takes to fall asleep
    - It also decreases total sleeping time, especially in the elderly
    - Although coffee and tea are the most concentrated sources of caffeine, it is also found in soda, cocoa, energy drinks and several types of medication 
    - Research has shown that caffeine remains in your system for an average of five with the negative effects on the body lasting up to 9+ hours

Digestive Issues
    - Many people find that coffee gives them a trip to the bathroom soon after with it's laxative effect
    - Coffee's laxative effect is from the release of gastrin, a hormone the stomach produces that speeds up activity in the colon.
    - Caffeine itself also causes bowel movements by increasing peristalis (the contractions that move food through your digestive tract)
    - Overtime the acidic nature of coffee drank on an empty stomach may lead to stomach ulcers
    - Studies suggest caffeine beverages worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), especially coffee

Muscle Breakdown
    - Rhabdomyolysis is a very serious condition in which damaged muscle fibers enter the bloodstream, leading to kidney failure and other problems
    - There have been several reports of rhabdomyolysis related to excessive caffeine intake
    
Addiction 
    - Caffeine is extremely habit forming, the energy feels good and our brain wants more
    - Caffeine triggers certain brain chemicals similiarily to the way cocaine and amphetamines do 
    - May lead to psychological or physical dependency
    - Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, fatigue, brain fog, among others
    
High Blood Pressure
    - Several studies have shown caffeine to raise blood pressure due to its stimulatory effect on the nervous system 
    - Elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke because it may damage arteries over time, restricting flow of blood to your heart and brain
    - Caffeine intake has also been shown to raise blood pressure during exercise 
    
Rapid Heart Rate
    - The stimulatory effects of high caffeine intake may cause your heart to beat faster
    - It may also lead to altered heartbeat rhythm, (called atrial fibrillation) which has been reported in young peopl who consumed energy drinks
    - In one case study a woman who took caffeine powder and tablets in an attempted suicide developed a very rapid heart rate, kidney failure and other serious health issues

Fatigue
    - Coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages are known to boost energy levels
    - However they also have the opposite effect by leading to rebound fatigue after caffeine leaves your system
    - Studie show that although caffeinated energy drinks increased alertness and improved mood for several hours, participants were often more tired than usual the following day 

Frequent Urination and Urgency 
    - Increased urination is a common side effect of high caffeine intake due to the compound's stimulatory effects on the bladder
    - High intake may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence (lack of control over urination) in people with healthy bladders
