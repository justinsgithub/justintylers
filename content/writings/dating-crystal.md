Been dreaming of you my whole life 

Look at my family, don’t gotta ask why

Wondered what made you so special 

What made you better than the rest 

---

Lead people on forever 

Just can’t get enough of you

Even as you lead them to death 

They all say you’d be so bad for me 

But they all say try things before you judge it true

Life had me so lost and confused 

So when she came around, what did you think I’d do?



---

Fantasized about you before 

Not enough time in the day, I need more

What if I just didn’t sleep as much? 

Imagine what I could accomplish 

Start ignoring my conscience

So much ephedrine got me nauseous 



---

If only there was a super drug 

I know there is but heard it’s nasty stuff

But ephedra got me feeling kinda rough

This Pharma shit just kinda sucks

So she’s been in the back of my brain 

Could the pleasure be worth all the pain?



---

But these are just my normal crazy thoughts 

Chalk it up as crazy talk 

Don’t even know where to find you

Wasn’t desperate enough to be tryin to 



---

But my problems started catching up 

4 years of the same old shit 

Running in circles, nothing seems legit

Life is getting so damn tough

Can’t seem to work it out with love

Two weeks, two traumatic breakups



---

Screw it I’m done with this stuff 

I’m done with girls, gonna sober up 

Focus on my career until I’m stable

Until I’m ready and I’m able 



---

But I’m a mess and my heart is shattered 

Caused this myself 

Trying to pretend it doesn’t matter 

So I’m getting wasted one more time

Get back on track tomorrow

One more night to drown my sorrows 

Need to find some love to borrow



---

Text females in my cellphone 

What’s up tonight, are you home?

Find someone to kick it with 

We can be together alone 

Quick lust for the night to help me forget 

Just want to be emotionless 



---

Phones buzzin, I find someone down

She says come over right now

Before I leave I down some crown 

Trying to make these memories drown

Fake a smile to hide this frown 

Drive over to this girls house 

We’re chilling, just hanging now



---

And that’s when she asks me 

Should my friend Crystal come hangout?

I was so blindsided

Never thought this could happen

Didn’t know they were friends 



---

This was it, this was my moment 

To follow in those footsteps 

Deep down fearing this day would come

Addictive nature since I was young 



---

I may never get another chance 

So I said yes, give me this dance 

And then begins a Crystal romance 

Never want her her out my pants 

Got her number never lost it 

Keep her protected in my pocket 

Folded away inside my wallet 



---

Crystal took away all of my pain 

She made me able to breathe again

Not stressing about work or the gym 

But I got a new girl 

So she’s my dirty secret 

Sneak her in the bathroom 

No one knows I keep it 

Smell her inside my souls 

Careful I don’t do too much 

But she still began to take her toll 



---

I was getting more attached to her 

She was becoming my main girl 

Chasing her everywhere 

Choose her over my girlfriend 

She just made me feel so free 

I could be myself finally

But I could feel her strangling me 

Don’t want to talk unless I’m with her

Late to work cause I’m crushing on her



---

Things started getting toxic 

She’s keeping me from all my friends

Her needs are so exhaustive 

But I promised we would never end 



---

She made me a better person 

Love others instead of hurtin

Only hurting me 

Care more for others more than myself

Just look at how nice I am 

I am such a good, kind man

She’s destroying me ego 

I’m too high to ever say no 

Threesomes with her and other girls 

But of course only we know

Living in my own twisted world 



---

People say I have a problem 

I think all I do is solve them 

I say I’ve always had them 

But crystal makes it better

Gets me through the bad weather 

And without food or a sweater 

Still have an appetite 

Unless I’m too distracted 

Can’t eat healthy anymore 

Body’s feeling plastic 



---

Lying to myself until I lose my job

They offered help, I said I’d rather walk 

So I walked right out the door 

I know life has more in store 



---

Fights with my girlfriend getting toxic

She screams that I’ve lost it 

She hates me and wants me to die 

These girls are so exhaustive 

Feel like they got me hostage 

Why won’t they just leave me 

I’m begging and I’m pleading 

Why do you even care to see me 



---

Got a new job making way more money 

Who’s laughing now, oh so funny

Crystals now my main honey 

But I’m barely holding on 

Lost all my friends and my old girls gone

Just me and Crystal all alone 

I’m so depressed, nowhere to call home

Then I lost my second job 

Losing myself I begin to sob

Crying over everything 

Please help me I’m so damn lost 

Crystal won’t let you go my darling 

This is not your fault 

Start blaming other people 

They’re not treating me equal 

Everybody just wants to use me

Twisted voices in my head 

Then I start to blame myself

I know it’s my fault and no one else 



---

Crystal starts getting ugly 

She’s taking all my money 

No please, no thank you honey 

She wants to take my life from me

How did I let this happen?

Time flew by so quickly 

People say they miss me 

I realized they never ditched me 



---

Told Crystal we need to breakup 

It’s not you it’s me 

I have some things to figure out 

Slowly remembering myself 

Lost myself 5 years ago 

This isn’t the life I want

Won’t let you ruin the rest of life I’ve got



---

My only friend left says your nasty 

She contacted my family 

They said they’d take me in 

Time to put all this shit past me 

I finally forgave myself 

I’m finally accepting help 

Getting a lift out of this hell 

Thank you to everyone else 

5 year on drugs and alcohol 

Trying to live with myself 

Family caught me every time I fell 



---

For first time in my life 

I can honestly say I’m doing quite well 

Fell in love with all of life 

Even  cloudy days still feel so light 

Made it through the hardest times 



---

Now the future looks so bright 

I’m no longer scared of the darkest nights

Find joy no matter what’s happening 

Completed my pursuit of happiness 

Completely at peace at my happiest
