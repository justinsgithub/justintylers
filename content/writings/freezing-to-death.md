title: Freezing to Death
---

It's March 2016, I'm 20 years old.

I just got a new job in the oilfield in Alaska.

I also recently started partying hard for the first time in my life.

There was a big party tonight.

---

Friends came over to pregame at my place.

Like usual, I was gone before the pregame was over.

We showed up to the party.

It had started a while ago, people already everywhere.

---

I made my rounds and said hi to everyone.

I was extremely tan from my recent California trip.

With some extra assistance from a tanning drug / research chemical.

I would inject into my stomach, and it increases the pigment in your skin.

The amount of different drugs there are in the world really is incredible.

---

Everyone joked and made fun about my abnormally dark skin.

Some said it was kinda gross, I just thought it was funny.

My ex-girlfriend told me to never do it again. 

That's about all I remember when I heard, "The cops are here!"

---

Only one thought processed in my head at that moment.

I cannot mess this new job up.

I'll be a let down to everybody.

I would be a failure.

A disappointment to my boss, my family, my girlfriend.

There is no way I am risking jail.

---

My friends said they have no clue how I made it over the fence so quick.

I just remember thinking I would go through the fence if I had to.

There wasn't a chance I was going to get caught.

---

There was still snow on the ground and it was the middle of the night.

I was so drunk I was running while wobbling.

Almost like a long, drawn out, controlled fall. 

Trying to make as much distance as I could.

I would start leaning to the right, falling while running as fast as I could.

Until I found a tree to run into and rebalance myself.

Except instead of rebalancing, I would push off the tree and go running while leaning to the left.

---

This awkward, absurd, drunk running / swerving maneuver continued until I finally tripped.

I was so trashed I knew I was done running.

As I fell I managed to throw myself to the left into a bush under a tree.

Hoping I landed far enough away from any kind of path that the cops might come down. 

Of course if I was sober, I would have known there was no path whatsoever.

---

I laid there silent, paralyzed with fear.

There was no way I could let myself be caught.

I had a helicopter flight out to the oil rig the next day.

I couldn't let my boss down.

---

I was too drunk to feel how numb I was going from the cold.

I felt like nothing, my breathing shallow.

After some time passed, my phone rang.

I could barely move at this point.

It took all my determination to get my phone out of my pocket.

I could barely move my fingers, but I managed to answer.

It was my friend James.

---

"Dude where are you?!" -James 

"What happened with the cops?" -Me

"They're still here, where are you?" -James

"Are you with them?" -Me

"Yes they are trying to help me find you, are you still in the woods?" -James

"I can't let the cops find me, I'll lose my job" -Me

"Dude you'll freeze to death, they don't care about the party, they just want to make sure you're safe." -James

"They're just sending everybody home" -James

My mind was dead set. 

I would die before I let them find me.

"Goodbye James"

---

My phone dropped out of my hands.

I don't have the energy to pick it up. 

I couldn't feel my body.

I was barely able to reach out my finger and hit the red button to end call.

I closed my eyes and went to sleep, I was done, drifting away to nothingness. 

---

"JUSTIN!!!"

My foggy consciousness came back, I don't know where I am.

"JUSTIN!!!" 

It sounds like James.

"JUSTIN SAY SOMETHING!!"

Then I remember.

I think I might die.

A flood of panic sets over me and I scream 

"JAMES!!!" 

"JAMES I'M HERE!!!" -Me

"I hear you, keep yelling!!" -James

After a few more back and forths, I lose energy and can't yell anymore. 

Moments later, I feel a hand on my shoulder.

"I got you bro"

---

James pretty much picks me up off the ground.

I can barely assist him.

Most of my body weight is leaned on him as he carries me back to the car.

---

The copes let the party go.

I guess some people suggested an after party at my place.

They showed up at my house to drink more.

My friends helped me into the bathtub with a hot shower.

I laid there while the party went on. 

---

That was not the first or last time I had to be assisted or carried out of a party.

Luckily I've had some of the best friends in the world or I would've landed in some worse places.

I now have very negative feelings around being cold to say the least.
