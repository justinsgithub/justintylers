Carbohydrates are 1 one of the 4 macronutrients alongside proteins, fats, and alcohols that make up calories and give us energy.

Here are some key points about carbohydrates;

Overview
    - Carbohydrates are molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in specific ratios
    - Carbo (carbon) + hydrate (hydrogen and oxygen make up water)
    - The main purpose of carbs is to provide your body with energy 
    - Majority of carbs in foods you eat are digested, turned to glucose, then enter the bloodstream
    
How carbs work
    - After glucose enters the blood stream it is taken up by your cells and used to produce fuel for your body
    - Glucose produces fuel by way of molecules called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a series of complex processes termed as cellular respiration 
    - Cells can then use ATP to power a variety of metabolic tasks
    - Majority of cells can produce ATP from multiple sources including dietary carbs and fats
    - Our bodies will prefer getting ATP from carbs as our primary energy source 

Carbs provide stored energy for later
    - If we have enough glucose to satisfy our current needs, excess glucose can be stored for later use
    - Stored glucose is known as glycogen 
    - Glycogen is primarily found in the liver and muscle 
    - The liver contains approximately 100 grams of glycogen
    - Stored glucose molecules (glycogen) are released into the blood to provide energy throughout the body and help keep normal blood sugar levels between meals
    - Glycogen in muscles can only be used by muscle cells
    - Muscle glycogen is vital for high intensity excercise
    - Muscle glycogen amount varies more than the liver from person to person, but 500 grams on average 
    - When you have all the glucose you need, and glycogen stores are filled up, carbs are turned to fat
    - Excess carbohydrates are converted into tryglyceride molecules and stored as fat 

Carbs preserve muscle 
    - Glycogen storage is only one way your body ensures you have enough glucose to function properly
    - When glucose from carbohydrates is low, muscle is broken down into amino acids and converted into glucose or other compounds for energy 
    - Breaking down muscles is not ideal, since we need them to move well, look and feel good
    - Loss of muscle mass is associated with poor health 
    - Our bodies will break down muscle for energy to feed our brains which require glucose as well 
    - Consuming carbs is one way to prevent starvation of the brain from glucose and losing muscle mass
    
Promoting digestive health with fiber 
    - Aside from sugars and starches, dietary fiber is not broken down into glucose 
    - Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that goes through the body undigested 
    - Fiber is categorized into two main types 
    - The two main types of fiber are soluble and insoluble
    - Soluble fiber is found in oats, legumes and the inner part of fruits and some vegetables
    - While going through the body soluble fiber absorbs water into a gelish substance and makes bowel movement smoother
    - Studies show soluble fiber improves stool consistency and increases frequency of bowel movements.
    - Soluble Fiber also reduces straining and pain associated with bowel movements 
    - Insoluble fiber helps alleviate constipation by adding content to stools
    - Insoluble fiber is found in whole grains, skins, seeds of fruits and vegetables
    - Getting proper insoluble fiber protects against digestive tract disease 
    - Studies show a higher intake of insoluble fiber associated with 37% lower risk of diverticular disease
    - Diverticular disease occurs when pouches develop in the intestine
    
Heart health and diabetes 
    - Eating too many refined carbs is negative to your heart and can increase risk of diabetes 
    - Eating fiber carbs can benefit your heart and blood sugar levels 
    - As soluble fiber goes through the small intestine it absorbs bile acids
    - To make more bile acid, the liver uses cholesterol which would otherwise be left in blood causing high cholesterol 
    - Studies show heart disease risk lowers by 9% for each 7 grams of dietary fiber consumed per day
    - Fiber does not raise blood sugar levels like other carbohydrates do 
    - Soluble fiber helps delay absorption of carbs into digestive tract, keeping blood sugar lower after meals
    - Soluble fiber lowers levels of A1c
    - A1c is a molecule that shows average blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months
    
    Fats instead of carbs
        - Carbs play many important roles in the body as stated above 
        - However our bodies are resillient and can do many of these things without carbs 
        - Almost all cells in the body can generate fuel from ATP from fat 
        - Our largest form of stored energy is not glycogen
        - Our largest form of stored energy is triglyceride molecules stored in fat tissue
        
    Ketosis
        - Majority of the time, our brains use almost exclusively glucose for fuel 
        - During times of starvation or super low carb diets, the brain shifts its main fuel to ketone bodies (ketones)
        - Ketones are molecules formed from the breakdown of fatty acids
        - Our bodies create them when we don't have enough carbs available for the energy we need to function
        - Ketosis is when the body produces large amounts of ketones to use for energy 
        - Ketosis is not harmful and different from ketoacidosis 
        - Even when ketones become the primary fuel source for the brain, the brain still needs about 1/3 of its energy to come from glucose via muscle breakdown and other sources 
        - Using ketones instead of glucose reduces the amount of muscle that needs broken down for energy 
        - Shifting to ketones from glucose allows humans to live weeks without food
