title: Won’t Stop Me
---

Don’t try to stop me

I have this tunnel vision 

I cannot hear you 

---

I will not see you 

I will not listen to you 

I listen to God 

---

I do what I want 

And my wants are what God wants 

They do come from God

---

Do not get me wrong 

I do appreciate you 

I do feel your love 

---

I hope you feel mine 

But I am on a mission 

And my head is hard 

---

And my heart is gold 

My mind is made of diamonds 

I cannot be stopped

---

So please do not try 

Do not get into my way 

It will do nothing 

---

But maybe hurt you 

Do not ask me to relax 

Don’t say just slow down 

---

I know what i want 

God will tell me otherwise 

So unless you’re God 

---

Just let me be me 

And I will let you be you 

Thank you, I love you
