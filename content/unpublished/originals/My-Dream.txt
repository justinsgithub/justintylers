My Dream

A life without a dream seems too empty to me 
One day I realized I didn't have dreams anymore
I threw them all away our the door 
And this is not a way to live for me 
So I've been doing some thinking 
What would be the dream for me?

I've heard of a good practice before 
Start by writing down what your perfect day might be like 
So this is what I got, starting to craft my dream 

Waking up in the morning with my gorgeous girl 
Maybe to a beautiful view 
With a breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon, and fresh fruit 
A good workout to start the day 

Work doing what I love, working with people, helping them, maybe teaching or coaching health
Football on the beach with my bros, friends and family 
A barbeque for dinner with all my loved ones 
Maybe some games, video games, a movie 

I've been creating my dream, there's a long ways to go 
Create a career where I love what I do 
Get enough money to get everyone at one destination if I have to   
Have optimal health for the energy to create the career of my dreams 
Have the discipline not to stray and stay focused, stay authentic, be myself 
Have the financial freedom to live life to the fullest extent 
Have the confidence and courage to pursue whatever path I choose and not let the doubt and negativity in the world get to me 

Practice spirituality and wisdom to know what is good for me and what will end up bad for me 
Make sure I don't caught up in the superficial, meaningless things of the world that will deter me from my dreams and goals 
Spend quality time with myself so I never lose myself again trying to be something for the world instead of being something for me 
Read, Write, Dance, and Sing as much as possible cause those are things I love to do 

Have the self awareness to know when I am having sad times that it's just a moment, and I might just be tired or hungry, and these moments pass 
Give my attention and focus 100% to what I should be, and don't let meaningless distractions stop me from connecting my fullest to the current moment I am in 

Always be grateful for everyone who's supported me in life, and taught me, and helped shape me into the person I am today
Always acknowledge that I would be nothing if not for the amazing people I've been blessed with my entire life, and the amazing people I am blessed to be around and work with every day 
Have the strength and toughness to always be honest and open as possible with myself, with others, with women 

Remember that In a life that is so advanced, the most complex task can be keeping things simple
