I took almost every anabolic steroids known to bodybuilders from February 2016 - June 2020

I took everything from the classic steroid Dianabol, to the worlds strongest and most toxic steroid trenbolone

I also took “designer” OTC steroids, which are in a more legal grey area 

This is meant to be a concise detailing of the different effects anabolic steroids had on me during my 4 year run 

The initial effects 
 - Extreme muscle soreness at injection spots 
 - Really bad acne across forehead, back, chest, shoulders 
 - 15 pound weight gain within 1 month (mostly water)
 - Massive estrogen spikes 
 - Miserable insomnia 
 - Depressive mood swings
 - Exaggerated my suicidal thoughts
 - Rollercoaster sex drive, either super high or super low
 - 50+ pound increase on all my gym lifts within a couple months 
 - Extreme appetite 
 - Terrible food cravings 
 - Started having an eating disorder 


It took at least a year to get adjusted and learn how to dose the testosterone properly to minimize side effects 

 I continually had to use stimulants and other drugs to counteract some side effects 


 Continual side effects from first 2 years 
  - Insomnia 
  - Lethargy
  - Tiredness
  - Abnormal muscle soreness 
  - Obnoxious / annoying night time erections 
  - Acne 
  - Kept my initial strength boost but didn’t gain too much after that 
  - Terrible food cravings 
  - Continued eating disorder 
  


Just like with all drugs, I ended up taking more and more 

After 2 years I began using a wide variety of the strongest anabolic steroids 

I used up to 700 mg / week of trenbolone 

I ended up cruising on 50 - 100 mg trenbolone / week 



Effects from the last 2 years 
  - Horrid insomnia, awake for up to 3 days straight 
  - Miserably tired 
  - Extreme fatigue, lethargy
  - Worsened suicidal thoughts, anxiety 
  - Lower body fat 
  - Counteracted weight loss from hard drugs 
  - Unhealthy cardiovascular system 
  - High blood pressure 
  - High resting heart rate 
  - Paranoia 
  - Joint pain
  - Weird smelling pee
  - Dark colored pee
