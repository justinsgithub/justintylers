Dear Waitress

You probably don't remember me
At a diner in Anchorage, Alaska
March 2016
Don't remember which 
I was pretty drunk 
Was pretty much always drunk in those days

Life's pains had become a lot for me
My best friend had just died
Didn't know how to cope with death
Didn't want to cope with life
Death had never been reality to me
I didn't realize I just started a drug addiction 
Along with alcohol abuse
A downer to counter the uppers

I didn't feel I belonged here any longer
Felt I didn't deserve it 
He was so much better than me 
If he couldn't have this life
Why should I?
Yet another person who wouldn't stay for me
Why should I stay?

I was walking alone through the city 
Had made up my mind 
Stopped in your diner for one last bite
Ordered a slice of pie
You asked if I was alright
Of course I said I'm fine

Typed notes in my phone to loved ones
To leave behind, to say goodbye
I was going off the hotel roof tonight
Your act of kindness changed my mind
Paid for my slice
A stranger saved my life
I'll never forget you 

Thank you so much, I love you
