Page From My Heart

My life has been a trip
Highest times and darkest darks 
But the waves are calming now 
The storms are calming down 

I’m finally growing up 
Tired of parties now 
Learning was life’s really about 
Jot these words while I figure it out 

Made so many friends a long the way 
Not a single one that I’ve forgot 
Lost so many too 
They all keep special places in my heart 

I’ve become an open book 
Pages in my heart 
And this page is for you 

Been a long while since we talked 
Keep up on social media 
Happy to see you happy 
Thankful for our friendship 
You helped me learn a lot 

Crushed on you for far too long
Friendzoned the whole time 
Helped eachother through growing pains 
Talked about our insecurities 
Got so close I loved you like no other 
And when it came down to it 
Could never do the dirty 

Your smile’s a true work of art 
I love you girl and I always will 
So here’s a page straight from my heart 
Xoxo, send this to you in my last will
