title: Tear Drops 
---

Tear drops fall so hard

Like a storm that’s in my arms 

She pleads please don’t leave 

---

I plead please let me 

It’s clear we’re tearing apart 

It’s tearing my heart 

---

I can barely breathe 

This whole thing is killing me 

Please just let me leave 

---

Can’t let myself stay

Broke your heart too many times

I must say goodbye 

---

I’m no good for you 

You are too perfect for me 

I fell like the leaves 

---

With no choice at all 

But it is no longer fall 

I’m growing like spring 

---

And you’re killing me 

No fertilizer at all

More like chemicals 

---

Keep stunting my growth 

So I know I gotta go 

Just not ready yet 

---

Please just understand 

Wish I could just hold your hand 

But it holds me back 

---

Breaking promises 

I made too drunk off a fifth 

And I’m so sorry 

---

I’ll always love you 

I will never forget you 

I thank you, goodbye
