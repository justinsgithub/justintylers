The importance of a good night of sleep cannot be exaggerated. 
Depending on the individual and time of year, your body needs between 7-10 hours of sleep per night.
Without enough quality sleep negative health effects can occur daily.
These health effects can add up to worse health consequences down the road.

Negative health effects from poor sleep:
- memory issues
- mood swings 
- weakened immune system 
- higher risk for diabetes 
- low sex drive (decrease in testosterone)
- increased body fat 
- decreased muscle mass
- lower human growth hormone (HGH)
- troubled thinking and concentration 
- high blood pressure 
- weight gain (less leptin production)
- more hunger (higher ghrelin levels)
- risk of heart disease
- poor balance
- worsened motor skills 

Using caffeine to make up for tiredness from a bad night's sleep can worsen the problem.
Stimulants make it harder to fall asleep at night which creates a toxic cycle. 
You may end up relying on caffeine just to feel normal and be too tired to function optimally without it.

Our bodies need sleep more than food or water, death can happen within a fews days of no sleep.

During sleep new pathways form between nerve cells (neurons) in our brain that help us remember new information we've learned.

Sleep deprivation lowers our mental abilities and heightens emotions.

Poor sleep can also lead to:
- anxiety 
- depression 
- paranoia 
- impulsive behavior 
- suicidal thoughts 

During sleep our immune system produces antibodies and cytokines, which protect us from bacteria and viruses.

Poor sleep can lead to weight gain and obesity.
- we produce hormones during sleep. 
- leptin is a hormone that tells our brain when we've eaten enough.
- ghrelin is an appetite stimulant that tells us we're hungry.
- with poor sleep we get lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels.
- these hormones play a role in late time snacking and overeating as well.

Poor sleep causes less insulin to release after eating. 
Insulin lowers our blood sugar levels.

Some common sleep disorders for which you may need to see a doctor:
- sleep apnea 
- narcolepsy 
- restless leg syndrome 
- insomnia 
- circadian rhythm disorders 

Tips to help improve sleep or sleep schedule:
- limit day time naps 
- no caffeine past noon (or at all)
- same bed time each night 
- same wake up time each morning 
- don't stray from sleep schedule too much on weekends 
- relaxing activities before bed (reading, meditation, bath, journaling, writing)
- avoid heavy meals within a few hours of bed
- don't eat past 6 - 7pm
- no electronics 30 minutes to 1 hour before bed 
- exercise (not too close to bed time)
- reduce alcohol intake
