Hallucinogenic mushrooms changed me and my life forever. 
"Shrooms" are used as plant medicines to help heal trauma and spiritual growth in other cultures. 
"Magic mushrooms" can help detox your ego and see things from a different perspective. They can "rewire" your brain into different thought patterns and help self-realization. 
This allows you to give an honest look at yourself and into your life, which can be alot to handle for many.

It was 2014, the summer after graduating highschool. 
I was focused on hockey, doing summer camps and training in the gym. 
I got ahold of some shrooms, me and a couple friends decided we were going to try them one night.
Shrooms made me questions everything about myself.

I thought I was going to see dragons and cool things. 
I just wanted to feel the magic of seeing things that didn't exist in the real world. 
It always sounded so cool.
Instead I realized how lost and scared I was of life. 
I realized I had no real confidence and had alot of self hate and insecurities that fueled alot of my actions.

We took the shrooms with some orange juice. 
We waited an hour and nothing happened, so we took more. 
We waited another 30 minutes and still nothing, so we took the rest that we had.

Almost 2 hours had passed and we began to lose hope. 
Then at about the 2 hour mark a pool stick on the wall began to morph and wobble.
I started to freak out with excitement and the whole room started changing shades of color.
The patterns on the wall began moving and swirling.

I shut the tv off and put my phone away to get rid of any distractions. 
I wanted to trip as hard as i could. 
I went to the room and laid down, staring at the patterns and colors swirling on the walls and ceilings.

The trip intensified.
Alone with my thoughts they started racing.
I asked myself questions I never had before. 
What am i doing here?
Why do i try so hard?
Whats the point of doing anything?
What am i trying to prove?
Why do i try to be better than everyone? 
Who am I kidding?
I am no better than anyone.
I am a fake, a lie.
I act so tough, but i'm so scared.
I have no clue what i'm doing in life. 
I  completely screwed off high school.
I'll be a loser now, a failure.
I am no good at hockey, i just try hard.
I can't go play juniors, and i don't want to.
I should just admit i'm a loser, a failure, and have no plan for life.

These conversations played over in my head until i couldnt take it anymore and stood up. 
I told my friends my newfound realizations.
They suggested we go outside and trip. 
I went out to the living room and really lost it.

I asked them what we were gonna do outside.
They said they didnt know.
I told them i just really wanted to scream. 
Then i started screaming, it felt good.

I yelled as hard as i could, i could feel my stomach and throat muscles sretched. 
Then when i was tired out i broke down hysterically crying. 
My friends tried getting me to calm down but i couldnt.
I tried to stop crying then went straight back to screaming as loud as i could.
It was like puking where you have no control in how hard you are vomiting.

I went back and forth in this hysteria, and didn't think i would ever regain control of myself.
Maybe deep down i didn't want to.
Maybe deep down i didn't want to face life anymore and going crazy was my way out.

Finally after what seemed like hours I caught myself. 
I was able to control myself and halt the screaming, at least for the moment.
My friends were surprised, checking if i was really okay.
I told them I was, that i was back to normal.
They were hesitant to believe me.

How did i just go from losing my mind to normal in a split second? 
I didn't believe me either. 
It felt like I was faking being normal.
But as long as i could fake it until i was able to get home i would be okay. 
I could hide the fact that my mind had judt changed forever. 
I could pretend i was just the same person and that was just a bad trip. 
I could ignore the conversations i had with myself the night before.

I quit pursuing hockey that week.
I realized how much I really cared for other people but always pushed them away because of my insecurities.
I started believing that i am a nobody and everyone is better than me.
I quit ever being mean to other people.
I realized everyone is equal and goes through hard times.
I realized that i was a terrible and jugdemental person alot. 
I stopped judging others for stupid things and developed love for all people. 

That first mushrooms trip 6.5 years ago was the start of my new path here today. 
It was my first tiny peek into spiritually and the real meaning of life.
It took many more battles with my ego to get rid of all the toxicity and pain i had built up inside me.

I had built up a large ego throughout life to protect me from false fears i had developed in my childhood.
Detoxing my ego almost killed me, stripping my self-confidence, and self-worth away. 
Feeling so low and dealing with substance abuse brought suicidal thoughts along.
When so much of your beliefs and identity is tied up in an unhealthy ego, many people may never want to even attempt getting rid of it.

If I was ever going to take hallucinogenic mushrooms again it would be with extreme care, intent, and purpose. 
I am very careful with eveything i do in life at this point. 
I am still recovering from the years of substance abuse and building new healthy habits and thought patterns.
