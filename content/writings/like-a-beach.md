title: Like A Beach 
date: 2021
---

Got a body like a beach 

I just wanna play 

Get burned if I stay too long 

---

Stuck in bed all the next day 

Finally said hi

Now you’re stuck up in my head 

---

This girls too good to be true 

She is perfection

There’s no way that I’m enough 

---

I just wanna surf her waves 

Let her ride all night 

And did I mention her eyes?

---

They got me so paralyzed 

Deepest ocean blue

My wildest dreams coming true 

---

Always be my favorite beach 

My best memories 

My favorite vacation 

---

I never wanted to leave 

You’re too good for me 

But you wouldn’t accept that 

---

Buried me inside your sand 

Trapped me in your love 

You got me suffocating 

---

But I can’t breathe without you 

Laying on your beach 

Never want to leave your bed 

---

But my head is playing games

Can’t be without you 

Reality kicking in 

---

This is too good to be true 

So we had to end 

Goodbye to my ocean eyes 

---

Still see you inside my dreams 

Favorite memories 

My favorite vacation
