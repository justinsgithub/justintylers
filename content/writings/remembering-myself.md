title: Remembering Myself
---

Feels like it's been so damn long

I'm a little bit confused

Remembering who I am

What do I even stand for?

---

Spent so long just not myself

Didn't care about my health

Still cared for everyone else

Always put myself through hell 

---

Working 80 hour weeks 

Sometimes work 12 weeks nonstop

Couldn't keep relationships

They want too much of my time

I couldn't give them a day

Like how did I get this way?

---

Make money just to blow it

On parties and stupid shit

Look at this gun I just bought

No intent of shooting it 

They said I'm living too fast

I didn't listen a bit

---

Of course several times I crashed

Clean up a bit and then relapse

Like I don't recall the past

This times different, grew past that

---

Landed in the ER twice

Too many drugs the previous night

Not caring about my life

I'm the life of the party

Can't believe I almost died 

Took so long to learn my lessons

---

Acted like I had it all together 

Ignored being under the weather

Like I got booze, don't need a sweater

Cause I'm tough, got no problems

Like I don't need your help to solve them

---

But one too many heartbreaks

Couldn't stand all of the heartache

I landed in such a dark place

Pills to cope with all the heart pain

Then I'm taking anything

---

Give me pills with vodka 

Give me all the hard stuff 

Give me anything to relax

My values and system have gone all whack

---

These girls just won't go away

On and off like night and day

Two break-ups in a row now

I really need to slow down

My heart left bleeding on the ground

---

Got my exes really pissed off

Hell hath no fury 

Stealing money off my cards

But I'm too high too worry

I just don't care about myself

Care about everyone else

Losing weight and declining health

My visions getting blurry

---

Constant guilt trips in my head

Crippling anxiety 

I think I deserve the worst

I know I made this bed I sleep in

I know I invited these girls to creep in 

Tried not to let feelings steepen 

But the love always seems to deepen

Sowed these things I'm reaping

Nightmares of breakups while I'm sleeping

These emotions start to exhaust me

Feel my heart exhausting

---

Can't make a good decision 

But drugs feel like I'm always winning

Now where the hell did time go?

I was 19 just moments ago 

---

Feels like I just ran in circles

Feels like my life has been a circus

Feels like I'm the biggest clown

Smile hides what's under the surface

High than low, so up and down

---

Time to get off this roller coaster

It's been wild, time for me to grow now

Went through hell but learned a lot

Time to give life all I've got

Time to finally be myself

No more trying to be someone else

I like me the way I am

Picking myself up out of hell 

---

No more drugs to balance me 

No alcohol to relax

So I guess instead I'll read 

Writing to help vent my thoughts

Instead of trying to ignore them

---

Remembering myself again

And everything I care about

Take this pen and wear out

Until I am completely myself again

---

I loved who I used to be 

Sorry drugs, it's not you, it's me

Haven't been myself since just a teen

Only remnants and make believe

Substances really got me 

Alcohol and capsules mixed with molly

---

Sober things are looking up 

My lows are no longer so tough

Peaceful melancholy

Now I just go monotone 

While I organize the thoughts inside my dome

Something I could never do before

---

Now I think about the world

Sit and think about my life

Now I enjoy being alone

Now I love being myself again

---

Even when times get dreary 

And start thinking about drugs again

Conscience enough to start thinking clearly

Write a letter to myself like

Dear Me,

Remember what you stand for

Remember who you love

You finally beat that damn war

You know you're too strong for drugs

---

Relapse is no longer possible

You know failing is impossible

Got too much to live for now

Live and learned and growing now

Just want to make myself proud

Everyday a little better

Everyday I'm more myself

Better than I've ever been

So happy I sing out loud

Gave myself another chance 

Missed all my family and all my friends

All I wanna do is dance

Won't waste this life, I'll live it well 

---

Sincerely yours, Myself
