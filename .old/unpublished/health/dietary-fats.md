Dietary fats are often a misunderstood topic. 

Fats are 1 of the 4 macro nutrients aside from proteins, carbohydrates, and alcohols.

Fats have 9 calories per gram, which can lead to better satiation at similar food volumes to carbs.

There are several different types of dietary fats.
- Saturated
- Unsaturated (2 types)
- Trans fat (natural and artificial)

All of the fats listed have shown numerous health benefits, aside from artificial trans fat which are highly toxic to our bodies.

Eating the correct kind of fats from good food sources can have numerous health benefits.

Eating foods with healthy fats is often a better choice over processed foods with refined carbs and sugars.

This is an overview on healthy dietary fats;

Healthy fats help: 
 - energy 
 - hormone production 
 - nutrient absorption 
 - cell growth
 - thermogenic effect 
 - organ protection 
 - satiation (fighting hunger)
 - lower cholesterol 
 - immune system 
 - regulate body temperature 
 - absorb vitamins A, D, E, K
 - provide structure for cell membrane 
 - influence multiple biological functions 

The 2 types of unsaturated fat
- polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)
- monounsaturated fats (MUFA)
- liquid at room temperature (olive oil)

Polyunsaturated fats:
- increase good cholesterol (HDL)
- reduce risk of cardiovascular disease 
- contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids

Foods with polyunsaturated fats
- fish 
- ground flax seed 
- avocado oil
- olive oil 
- nuts
- seeds 

Monounsaturated fats:
- decrease LDL (bad cholesterol)
- reduce risks of cardiovascular 
- maintain good cholesterol 

Foods with monounsaturated fats:
- nuts 
- avocados 
- olives 
- grape seed oil 
- sesame oil 
- sunflower oil 
- some seeds and animal fats

Saturated fats:
- can decrease total cholesterol 
- increase HDL (good cholesterol)
- replacing refined carbs can decrease risk of cardiovascular disease 
- are solid at room temperature (butter)

Foods with saturated fats 
- whole milk 
- full-fat dairy products (butter, cheese, cream)
- lard
- solid oils like palm, kernel, coconut 
- steak, beef

All foods should be eaten in some moderation and a variety is always optimal. A variety ensures a good mix of vitamins and minerals.
