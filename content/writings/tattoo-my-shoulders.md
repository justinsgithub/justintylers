title: Tattoo My Shoulders 
---

How do I even explain

Everything you mean to me?

No words to express it 

I just got so damn lucky 

---

Not just one but two moms 

That taught me how to be a man 

Supported me all growing up 

Always at my sporting events

Acting like my biggest fans

---

Now tattoos just aren’t my style 

But I should have one on both my shoulders 

One for each my mother’s 

Thank you moms I love you both 

More than you could probably know 

---

Terra you taught me so many things 

We were just like best buddies 

Singing out loud in the car 

Taught me never to be lazy 

To always love and work so hard 

---

Taught me how to speak to woman

And how they really work 

Never hid the truth from me 

Always clear and honest 

Showed so much respect from me 

---

Treated me as your oldest 

Made me feel so valued 

Just as your own son 

And that’s just who you are 

Give so much love to everyone 

Give all of yourself for other people 

The shirt off your back if they ask 

---

Make anyone feel at home 

Give any favor they ever ask 

Sacrifice your own self care 

Caring for everybody else 

Sometime I worry it’s too much 

Sacrificing your health 

But never complain about yourself

Wish I could put you in a giant house 

And a farm where you could just relax 

I feel like I owe you endlessly 

Helped raise me so responsibly 

You’re part of who I am 

Everyday I stay so thankful 

Trying to be a better man 

Like you raised me to be 

No tattoos for me 

But I hope you know how much I love you 

---

Lorraine there’s one thing that upsets me 

That bothers me with you

That’s those thoughts inside your head 

That make you doubt yourself 

You need to know those just aren’t true 

---

I couldn’t ask for a better mother

Would never ask for any other 

Love when we learn from each other 

You mean everything to me 

---

Wish I could take care of you 

A mansion and a new Mercedes 

You got us through the hardest times 

When dad was gone you saved our lives 

---

We would’ve been so lost without you 

You rescued us at the perfect time 

Made sure we had everything we wanted 

Let me pursue my dreams 

Made me feel king of everything 

Taught me the realities of life 

Showed me what love really means 

How to take responsibility for your kids 

When you didn’t even have to 

You could have been free and lived 

But instead you sacrificed

Put our lives before your own 

I can’t thank you enough mom 

No tattoo on my shoulder 

But I love you endlessly and you better know 

---

So thankful for my mamas

Your boy is growning up now

No morning drinking til I throw up now

I’m sorry for all the stress 

Sure I went through some hard times 

But that’s just life 

And yours have been much harder than mine 

---

I’m no longer scared of my bad dreams 

No more drugs or alcohol 

Put those days behind me 

I’m ready to be the man you raised 

Take all your worries away 

I owe my life to you 

I won’t waste another second 

No tattoos on my shoulders 

But still know how thankful I am for you 

Thank You, I Love You
