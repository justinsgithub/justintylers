Caffeine

Caffeine in my blood 
I can feel it pulsating 
The worlds strongest drug 

And it is a drug
Research coffee chemicals 
An amazing drug 

It is just enough 
It won’t let you overdose 
But it keeps you buzzed 

Like crack heads for dope 
People wait in these long lines 
For their drug dealers 

But cute drug dealers 
They smile, they serve, that get paid 
High off their supply 

And every morning 
They know their fiends will be back 
For their lovely drug 

For without this drug 
Irritable from withdrawals 
And no energy 

With headaches so bad 
Only time before relapse 
See I’ve tried all drugs 

Just one keeps me long 
No drug dealer on speed dial 
She’s on every block 

Yes I’m addicted 
But I think it’s a fair trade 
My work flows smoother 

My mind more rapid 
Boost in creativity 
No smoking required 

But please be wary 
Every drug can be abused 
It can be deadly 

Caffeine can get you 
Drug dealers may up the strength 
And on accident 

What’s too much caffeine 
Varies individually 
Negative effects 

There’s anxiety 
Come downs, crashes, depression 
Adrenal fatigue 

Just to name a few 
So please do respect caffeine 
Controls you 12 hours
