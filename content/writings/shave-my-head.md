title: Shave My Head 
---


So I shaved my head 

Just to prove that I don’t care 

Lol so hard

---

Who am I fooling 

The fact is a care too much 

I need perfection 

---

Always seeking peace 

Might be a life long journey 

Don’t care what you think

---

Try not to think too hard 

But my mind spins so damn fast 

If, what if, what if 

---

Case scenarios 

The worst ones fly through my mind

Never seem to stop 

---

Stressed out all the time 

“Just don’t care what others think”

Wow such great advice 

---

Then I piss them off 

Cause my mouth can’t seem to stop 

I’ve lost all my friends 

---

1 year then they’re gone

So I guess I’ll shave my head 

Pretend I don’t care 

---

Now ROFL 

They can all see how I’m dressed 

But sure I don’t care 

---

Don’t want my hair back 

I’m too stubborn for that 

Just don’t want to care 

---

How do I do that 

Been spending time alone 

Just me and my thoughts 

---

Who the hell am I 

Still here searching for my place 

Doing things they say 

---

Should be good for me 

They said son you need Jesus 

So here I am now 

---

Reading the Bible 

Make another person proud 

Caring what they think 

---

So much I obsess

Try to find myself 

Read this book instead 

---

Cause I care too much 

What everybody else thinks 

I’m not scared of hell 

---

I’m just scared of you 

Read the Bible front to back 

Cause they say I should 

---

And I care so much 

Just want others happiness 

So I try so hard 

---

But I shaved my head 

To show that I just don’t care 

So you can’t judge me 

---

Based on gel I use 

Maybe you’ll say it’s ugly 

I expected that 

---

But see I don’t care 

Because I wasn’t trying 

So hold your judgements 

---

Only judge myself 

I’ll do what I think matters 

I will just do me 

---

Do the things I want 

Care about the things I want 

Perfectionist still 

---

And that’s what I want 

Keep your judgements to yourself 

I’m doing just fine
