Today I pray for the world

That it's not as lost as it seems

Why do people gotta be so mean 

Paying too much attention to technology screens

---

Today I pray for both my nieces

As they start getting older

Hope this world doesn't treat them too cruel

Hope they always know they're so beautiful

The world can be so ugly

---

Ask myself questions that are beyond me

Can't we all agree on some things?

See that we are all tired and in pain 

Maybe do a little more listening

---

Today I pray that I grow

Be the best I can 

Become a better man

Try my hardest

Will always have my flaws

Hard to keep my mouth from running off

---

Don't want to cause others pain anymore

Including myself

Want the truth to come out

All this fake fear to end

---

We don't always have to be right 

It's okay to be wrong

We can't always be right

Why can't we admit that we're wrong

---

Today I pray for the truth 

Let the secrets come loose

The news run out of lies to produce 

Won't live in fear

That's something I refuse

Before I spend life in a box

You can throw me a noose

---

Today I pray we forgive, let go, and rebuild

Work towards growing together

Instead of getting each other killed 

We're all doing our best

Trying to understand this mess

Try to remember how much we're blessed

Put down our phones, spend time with each other

Shut off our TVs, give a call to our fathers, sisters, mothers, and brothers

---

Let's make love, not war

That's more fun anyways

Start working towards better days

Take care of ourselves 

Care for our health

Learn, Love, prosper

Stop living in hell

Learn the true meaning of living well

---

Today I pray for our country

Today I pray for you
