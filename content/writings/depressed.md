title: Depressed 
---

As I lay in bed 

Why do I feel so depressed 

I ask myself this 

---

I should be so good 

Look at all of my cool stuff

Checkout my sleek car 

---

New girl from the bar 

Different women in my bed

Still stress in my head 

---

I’m never enough 

After 80 hour weeks 

I’m still incomplete 

---

Please what’s wrong with me 

Tell me what more can I do 

She validates me

---

She's so beautiful

But still I feel so distraught 

Please what’s going on 

---

What about my friends 

Only hang when I'm paying

Which I’m glad to do 

---

But I’m still so blue 

Why am I so damn depressed 

My head is such a mess 

---

I feel alone

When I leave no one is home 

Overthink these thoughts 

---

Is this really it 

Got money in the bank now

Bills paid for the year 

---

Money feels so fake 

I invest just to waste time 

Waiting up on girls 

---

But won’t make her mine 

Except maybe for the night 

Wonder why I try 

---

I’m fooling myself 

Lies to myself hurt like hell 

But what do I do 

---

Wanna make it through 

But everyday I’m more tired 

Living this fake life 

---

Lonely every night 

Convinced I will find no wife 

They all beg to stay 

---

But they don’t know me 

So I send them on their way 

Money, clothes, girls, drugs

---

Get me out this world 

It all feels so meaningless 

But I’m so obsessed 

---

Please where is my head 

Anxiety kicking in 

Somebody please help 

---

Before I’m locked in 

Trapped with these thoughts in my head

Why am I depressed 

---

Please just make them stop 

I just want it all to end

Just lost my best friend 

---

So please help me God 

I’m begging I’m so damn lost 

When will this all end 

---

Please just answer me

Get these voices out my head 

Telling me these lies 

---

No good piece of trash 

It’s getting hard to defend

Get me out of here 

---

I don’t want these things 

Dump the girls, trash all my stuff 

Even sell my car 

---

Anything to breathe 

Get some amount of relief 

I am not these things

---

Please God set me free 

Promise to do anything 

Just let me be me 

---

Superficial things 

Addictive technology 

Artificial foods 

---

All hate on the news 

Got me drowning in my blues 

But wait, I’ve got news 

---

Fuck you depression

I’m throwing out all this shit 

I’m being myself 

---

And for the first time 

I don’t feel like I’m in hell 

Goodbye depression
