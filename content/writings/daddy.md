title: Daddy 
---

She screams yes daddy 

But I thought she was playing

And 3 months later

---

She might be Satan

I am not actually your dad 

You need to grow up 

---

Not here to raise you 

I won’t put up with your fits 

Not my dependent

---

Won’t be your free ride 

Now quit calling me daddy 

Get out of my life 

---

You put me through hell 

Playing with all my emotions 

Make me want to yell 

---

Not acting myself 

Your stress has me on the edge 

Wishing that I fell 

---

Need away from you 

She’s a psychopath for sure 

She even warned me 

---

Thought she was joking 

Now she’s acting so insane 

Know I need to go 

---

But she screams and screams

I bail her ass out of jail 

Give all that I can 

---

But I’m not a dad 

And you're a grown ass woman 

Stay out of my bed 

---

No more yes daddy

Quit playing with my head 

Pay your own damn bills 

---

She’s got a new man 

And I pray for that fella

Good luck being dad
