It’s January 7th 

It happened 5 days from now 

Now we’re 5 years down the road 



---

Got a text from our buddy 

Already knew what happened 

Didn’t even have to ask 



---

Didn’t know how to take it

I never had someone pass 

And you are like a brother 



---

But it’s been a fast five years 

Just starting to recover 

Spend most days high since you left 



---

Didn’t know how to take death

Could never really face it 

Looking in the mirror now 



---

Turning my life back around 

Your death flipped it upside down 

Just wanted to impress you 



---

Show you how lean I could get 

Started taking ephedrine 

Addicted almost 5 years 



---

Just wanted to make you proud 

Hoping that you’d still see me

Hey Bro look how lean I am 



---

I might be starving myself 

And I’m getting weak as hell 

Using other drugs to help 



---

The addiction took its toll 

Balanced it with alcohol 

And I’m just a train wreck now



---

But I’m making good money 

I got in the oilfield

And gave up all of my dreams 



---

People say they’re proud of me 

I don’t get what they’re proud of 

Blow the money too quickly 



---

Cause now I know life’s too short 

Buying every drug I can 

I’m the life of the party 



---

But now all I want is death 

To party with you again

Substances won’t stay away 



---

So I fled from Alaska 

Just like we were planning to 

But my addictions followed 



---

Anything to mask the pain 

Pills, booze, ephedrine, cocaine 

No passion in my workouts 



---

All I want to do is work 

And keep you off my mind 

Spent almost 5 years mindless



---

You wouldn’t be proud of me 

It’s been a hell of a ride 

But I’m finally growing up 



---

I’m gonna make you proud now 

And show everybody love 

Just like you always wanted 



---

Yeahs it’s been a fast 5 years 

So many experiences 

And I’m learning from them all 



---

I refuse to fall again 

Defeated my addictions 

I killed all my bad habits 



---

I get high off life again 

No more drugs to pick me up 

I have my family for that 



---

I’m sorry it took 5 years 

For me to finally man up 

But I’m finally myself now 



---

Thanks for watching over me
