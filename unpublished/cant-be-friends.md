Can’t Be Friends

Remember when we first met? 
Said that we’d always be friends
Partied hard that whole weekend 
Drank until we both passed out

Oh man what a funny mess 
Loved you the first night you spent 
But then I made you promise 
Please don’t fall in love with me 

Don’t want a relationship 
Your friendship is all I need 
Want to be friends forever 
That is my priority 

Put our friendship before sex 
I never want to lose you 
Type of friend I’ve never had 
But everything changed so fast 

Started watching my cell phone 
Jealous over other girls 
I’m not even seeing them 
But you wanted my whole world 

You’re breaking our agreement 
This wasn’t what I wanted 
But you’re getting angry now 
And I don’t want to lose you 

I asked is this what you want?
You said yes just ask me out 
We’re breaking our agreement 
I asked are you really sure? 

And you repeated yourself 
3 months later we’re in hell 
What in the hell did we do? 
I tried breaking up with you 

Put some distance between us 
But you said you wouldn’t move 
From the place that we were at 
Told me it’s all or nothing 

You couldn’t just be my friend 
You said it would hurt too much 
You wouldn’t ever move on 
I didn’t want to lose you 

Tried my best to stick it out 
But this things just not working 
At this point there’s too much doubt 
Then the first got worse and worse 

Clearly losing each other 
You insist we can’t be friends 
A painfully slow breakup 
Hope one day you forgive me 

Never should have asked you out 
Should have been smarter than that 
Still getting to know myself 
And still missing you like hell 

Said we be friends forever 
Probably won’t speak again 
But I still pray everyday 
Somehow we’re friends in the end
