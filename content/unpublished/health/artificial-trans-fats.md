Artificial trans fats are manufactured fats, which are highly toxic to the body.  They're created from hydrogen molecules being pumped into vegetable oils.

If a food product has .5 grams of trans fat or less per serving, it can be hidden as 0g on food labels. Overtime ingesting this small amount of trans fat adds up to worsening health consequences.

The hydrogenation process makes fat more solid at room temperatures and less likely to become rancid.

The hydrogenation process which creates artificial trans fat is meant to prolong shelf life of processed foods.

Eating artificial trans fat:
- increases risk for heart disease 
- causes inflammation 
- damages inner lining of blood vessels 
- drives insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes 

Avoid any and all foods with "hydrogenated", or "partially hydrogenated" on the label.


There are 2 types of of trans fat. Naturally occurring trans fats are found in some meat and dairy foods. They do not have the same health consequences as the artificial trans fat from processed foods.
