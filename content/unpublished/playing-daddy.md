Playing Daddy

So tired of this shit 
So done playing with these girls 
So fed up with these games 
That do nothing for me 

Give so much energy 
Just to get nothing back 
I’m done playing daddy 
To girls that are too whack 

Schedule your doctor visits
Bail you out of jail
Have to wake you up for work 
But still you say I fail 

Breaking my promises 
But it’s time to grow up 
Sorry I let you down 
A loss I’ll have to take 

No kids for a reason 
Responsibility 
Too much for me right now 
I’m done playing daddy 
To grown ass woman now 

Learn to pay your own bills 
And learn some discipline 
Wake up on time for work 
Don’t always count on me 

You’re not my dependent 
But that’s how you’re acting 
Accountability 
A word that you should learn 
But I’m not a teacher 

Done playing with these girls 
Need some maturity 
I’m finally growing up 
I’m done playing daddy
