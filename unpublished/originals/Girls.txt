Girls

It’s a blessing and a curse 
Me and girls go together
Like lipstick in a purse 
Romance like the movies 
No need to rehearse 
But the endings always feel the worst
Put my heart straight in a hearse 
Too many feelings for a single verse 

But Everyday I miss every one
They’re all so gorgeous
How do I choose just one?
Swear I see 100 every day

What’s your name?
Where you from?
Where you goin?
Stay some nights
Have some fun 
Then they’re goin

Red heads, blondes, brunettes, dark hair 
Tan, Freckled, pale, I don’t care 
All so beautiful to me 
Such a blessing such a curse 

Dating seems to  go too fast 
Never lasts long enough 
I just need more life times 
All I listen to is love songs 

But now I’m in a hard place 
Cause I’m so tired of the heart breaks
Can we please just stay friends?
Don’t wanna make another heartache

Want you to know you’re beautiful 
You really do deserve the world 
But I can’t be that guy for you 
I’m being honest as I can 

Mind thinks fast and anxiety eats me 
How could I be good enough 
Your are far too perfect for me 
Fall in love with every flaw you have 

Your body shape is just for me 
Kiss you on every scar 
Your flaws make you perfectly unique
Imperfections create beauty 

Biggest blessing but a curse 
I love the way we vibe together 
When I’m down girls pick me up 
With you I’m never under the weather 
Make me feel like Superman 
Looking for my Lois Lane 
Done playing with Kryptonite 
Won’t let my lust make me weak 
Find the girl to make me stay 

Cherish every moment with you 
But cannot hurt anymore 
So girls please excuse me
While I’m trying to find myself 
Throwing my bad habits out the door 

Hate myself for hurting you 
Worst sin I could commit 
But I’m done playing those game 
Feeling ready to commit 
Thinking twice before jumping in 

I hope that you forgive me 
I fall in love too quickly 
Being careful before then next begins 
I take the blame can’t change the past 
Maybe the next will be my last 
Tired of the pain when I look back 
So here’s to changing my ways
So thankful for you every day
