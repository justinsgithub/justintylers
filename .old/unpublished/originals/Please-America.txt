Please America
We need your help, we are lost 
How do we be great? 

What’s America?
A land? A name? Just a word?
It is the people 

We’re America 
We must become great again 
Me must behave great

You’re America 
You must behave like you’re great 
You should be grateful

I’m America 
I will behave like I’m great 
I will be grateful 

We must be grateful 
Acknowledge our great blessings 
And take advantage 

Use our many tools 
Use tech to help the earth grow 
Not to demolish 

We are the people 
We make up America 
We’re responsible 

And we can do this 
We as individuals 
Make America 

Individually 
We must all pursue greatness 
Individually 

We all make a team 
Each player must perform great 
To achieve greatness 

We all must perform 
We have special positions 
Every one of us 

What’s your position? 
The most important of all  
We need you as you 

The best you can be 
There is only one of you 
Please be the best you 

The best employee 
The best spouse, parent, family
The best CEO 

How to be the best 
Kindness, love, health, honesty 
Practice compromise 

It all takes practice 
It all takes time and patience 
This will make us great 

You need all of us 
And we can be the greatest 
It all starts with you 

Please Americans 
I know you can do this 
Thanks America
