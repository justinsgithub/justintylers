title: Airport Detox
date: 2021
---

I'm visiting my family for the holidays

Taking a flight out of state

Debated taking my drugs with me

That might lead to a worse fate

I better let them stay

---

I almost missed the flight

Partied with my girl all night

Didn't want to leave her at home

Sad thoughts circling the dome

I feel the break up coming soon 

She can hear it in my tone



---

Cold sweats at the airport

My skin is tingling now

Feel people staring at me

Face is sunken in 

I should probably eat something

It's been quite a minute



---

I wonder just how bad I look

Swear people are staring at me

Maybe I'm just being paranoid 

Maybe they're talking about me

Wondering what's wrong with me

I try to look happy

Look like I've been through hell

Mood has never been so crappy



---

Go to the bathroom mirror

Now I'm in disbelief 

Never thought this could happen 

Don't even recognize myself 

I really need to eat 

My body's feeling so weak

Passed out for the entire flight

I just don't want to feel or think



---

Grab alcohol as soon as I land

A band aid for the withdrawals

Feel like I forgot everything

Going through my phone 

Trying to remember me 

My girl is tripping out

Says she's dying missing me

---

But I feel so dead inside 

Me and her don't coincide 

Never sober when i'm with her

Never sober period

Being sober sucks

Whiskey the whole visit home



---

Alcohol to kill my thoughts

A little more to kill my feelings

Now I feel fat and bloated

My muscles wasting away

I've got a problem, duly noted

Can't even stand to see myself



---

This detox didn't work at all

Ruined it with alcohol 

Soon as I get back I order up a ball

Give my supplier a call

Don't care what it's mixed with

Don't even ask



---

Cold sweats, cold thoughts, cold feelings

But these lines keep me warm

Sorry to my family, maybe I should've warned

I'm just not myself these days

But I don't tell anyone

Keep my problems secret

No one to relieve it 

Maybe next year I'll do better
