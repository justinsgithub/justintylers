I write these words 
Please tell me if you relate 
Write some of your own
<!--more-->

Let these words escape 
All the thoughts inside my head 
Are they reaching you?

Can you understand
All the things that I’ve been through? 
Well of course you can’t 

Still articulate 
So maybe one day I speak 
To a younger me 

Hold your head up high 
These troubles will pass you by 
What doesn’t kill you 

Will make you stronger 
So stick out all your struggles 
Bare through all the pain 

Time does heal all wounds 
Fake that smile until it’s real
Change for nobody 

Except for yourself 
Be unique, original 
Lead, never follow

You know yourself the best 
Only take your own advice 
Listen to others 
But cautiously

Humans can be so selfish 
It can be good though 
It can be healthy 
To a certain extent 
For to love others 
First you must love yourself 
Can’t pour from an empty glass 
Learned that the hard way 

But I sure did try 
Listen to these words I say 
Read the words I write 

Write some of your own 
Your own are the most truthful
