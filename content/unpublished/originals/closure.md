title: Closure

5 AM in the morning and I feel like I didn't sleep a wink.

Thoughts of you drown my mind and it feels like I'm fighting for breath all night.

Missing you like an addict misses their drugs, which I know far too much about.

I guess this one is for you.

--- 

Every hello ends with a goodbye, so why even try? But maybe that is the meaning of life. 

Crying about all of the losses, but happy those things were good enough to cry about.

Maybe sadness is a prerequisite for happiness. The rain before the rainbow that you never see the end of. 

The pot of gold is nothing but a distraction that takes away from the time spent admiring the beauty that is right before us.

Maybe my only regret would be all the times I let myself be distracted. Every minute I didn't make the most of, focusing on things that didn't matter.

---

Constantly kicking myself for never thinking I was enough for you, while pretending it was you who was not good enough for me.

Immature insecurities vanquished any chance we had. I hope you miss me... I hate myself for hoping that.

Over 1 year sober, the memories and feelings come flooding back in waves. I try not to drown as I learn new ways to cope.

I think you would be proud of me. But now you're gone and sometimes I wonder what the sobriety is even for. 

I guess it's for me, because truthfully I may be happier than ever.

---

I wish I realized our last goodbye. I would have held you so much longer.. I may never have let go. 

Maybe I never let go, a task I have always found so difficult to do.

I am letting go now, goodbye to past hopes and dreams, and hello to the new ones.

I will forever be grateful you gave me something to be so sad about losing. 

You helped showed me what love really is, gave me so many warnings before it would be tough.

---

I think of no good way to end this. Maybe there is no need and nothing truly ends, but just begins anew. I'm moving on and I'm moving forward. 

*Here is to you and your permanent place in my soul.*
*Here is to the future that I've worked so hard to create.*
*Here is to beautiful losses that made me.*
*Here is to me.*
