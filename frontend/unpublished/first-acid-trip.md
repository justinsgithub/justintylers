First Acid Trip

It was Summer 2016
I was on another drug run
A 2 hour drive all alone
Just broke up with my girl
Mood swings and paranoid all the time
Didn't trust anybody

Met with the dealer
Told him to give me everything he had
Called my buddy back home after the transaction was over
Told him I was headed back 

He says, "Justin, whatever you do, do not take the acid until you get back"

He was always looking out for me
I was never listening

I reply, "Okay, I won't"

"You promise?"

"Yes, I'm not an idiot"

I was an idiot
I hung up and immediately put a tab under my tongue
Then started the drive home smiling

It took about an hour for the effects to kick in
I smiled and laughed 
Wondering what situation I just got myself into 
Still had an hour to go

The sky started intensely changing color
Tried not to stare and stay focused on the road
Then the road started changing colors
I started to panic
This was a terrible decision

The middle, yellow line in the road started moving
It started shifting and wobbling
This isn't good

Well I either die today or go to jail
Secretly I had been hoping for jail for a while
Acting more and more wreckless
Hoping maybe jail would save me
Help me sober up 
Save me from myself
I really need help

The 2-lane highway transformed into 4 lanes
I'm in real trouble now
Turn the music down
Can't tell which lane I am in 
Staring intently at the road, hypnotized
Praying to God I'm in the right lane

Somehow don't see a single other car the last 45 minutes of the trip 
Or maybe I did
Eyes peeled open, too scared to blink
Heart hammering the whole time
Somehow I make it through the winding, swirling, rainbow road and arrive at home

A short hysterical laugh of excitement
I run inside the house, so happy I survived
My friends were there all worried
They said they had been calling me
I don't recall any phone calls
I check my phone
There were several missed calls

Oops

I tell them, "I took a tab as soon as we hung up"

"God damnit Justin, I knew you would do that"

"This stuff is awesome!", I reply

I dispersed some of the drugs and then went into my room 
Sat on my bed, and started staring at the floor in a trance.
The patterns on the hard wood swirling and transforming with eachother
I started asking myself questions

Why am I here?
What's the point in all this?
What am I doing?
I this really all that life is?
Why do I feel so empty?
Is this all life has to offer?

It can't be, I know that
I've seen the truth 
The truth is love, God, the universe, creation
Maybe I'm God
Maybe we are all God
Maybe we all control our own lives however we choose
We choose whether we live in heaven or hell
We are all powerful

But why were us humans put here?
Why do we deserve to be put above all other animals?
What makes us special?
Why were we chosen?
Why does mother nature allow us to flourish here?
What is our purpose?

It can't all be meaningless
We must have a reason
Maybe it's to save the animals
Maybe that's why we're here
One day the earth will day
So mother nature and the universe evolved us
So that we could find a home on other planets and keep living

What a brilliant theory
Maybe I actually should have kids
Choose a smart partner
Raise them to be geniuses
They'll work with NASA
Such beautiful ideas
I'll have to think about this some more later
I need to go back out to the party
