How I Started My 4 Year Anabolic Steroid Run

I started injecting steroids February 2016, a month after my best friends death

I snowballed into taking any and all drugs along with alcohol as a coping mechanism for the following 4.5 years

Drugs included steroids, which I stopped taking at the end of my meth run June 2020

People will try to downplay taking testosterone claiming they are still natural 

Testosterone is the best steroid there is, taking it synthetically is not natural no matter how low the dose 

This is how I got started with them

Intro 
   -I pretty much lived inside of a gym after high school
   -I worked for the “normal gym” and helped coach at the CrossFit gym
   -Steroids are a common and accepted part of the bodybuilding culture, (even encouraged) which I was surrounded by at all times
   -They are so common in the gym and bodybuilding, most the “gym bro’s” or “gym rats” assume anyone who’s a pro athlete or even somewhat successful in any physical endeavor must be on steroids
   -It was always an idea in my mind, but I never thought I would touch them until I was at least 30 and had no desire to compete in a drug tested sport
   
Leading up to steroids 
   -My best friend passed way January 2016
   -I had been training in CrossFit for a little over a year at this point
   -I had already started to suffer from over training and my body was breaking down, taking copious amounts of caffeine to try and make up for my lack of rest and proper recovery
   -My friend had always wanted to see how lean I could get if I ate a bodybuilder style diet and tried cutting weight
   -I decided I would get as a lean as possible to make him proud
   -To do this I started really abusing ephedrine. (An over the counter pharmaceutical, can be used to make meth)
   -This was the start of a downward spiral 
   
Why I started (funny story)
   -My dick stopped working properly. (not so funny at the time)
   -My body was braking down and my seasonal affective disorder was taking it’s toll 
   -I had gotten into parting hard consistently for the first tome in my life December 2015
   -I would continue to workout hard with no sleep using ephedrine to keep me going
   -To get lean for my deceased best friend I started starving myself “fasting”
   -only allowing myself to eat in an 8-hour window, sometimes less
   -I would make myself eat very little when I was allowed to in order to counteract calories I was getting from alcohol 
   -This led to my body deteriorating and sex drive tanking (which had always been obnoxiously high)
   -Even when I really wanted to have sex my dick just wouldn’t function properly, or stop after 5 minutes
   -This was extremely annoying and I had just gotten a new girlfriend which added to my stress made the situation even more frustrating
   -My best friend dying, my performance in the gym slowing, bedroom performance suffering felt like my life was falling apart
   -I lost my passion and drive for life and the gym
   -The memories with my bro in the gym were too painful to tolerate and I took a job in the oilfield to get away 
   -The goal of competing in anything went out the window so I decided taking testosterone would only benefit me
   -I immediately went to the doctors to get on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)
   
Getting started 
   -The doctor was not very much help to my ephedrine induced desires
   -Doctor gave me a list of things to try to bring my testosterone levels back up naturally before giving me a prescription 
   -I gave the list one look and then tossed it in the trash 
   -I went to the gym to find testosterone (steroids) on my own 
   -Finding steroids is extremely easy, just go to the gym and start a conversation with the abnormally large, red faced guy, with veins popping everywhere 
   -I studied testosterone, how it works,  and it’s effects on the body vigorously 
   -It did nothing to prepare me properly 
  
   -I got my hands on a bottle of testosterone and syringes within days of deciding I wanted to 
   -I was trashed at a friends house when I did my first injection 
   -I felt dependent on steroid from that point on
   -I worried my body would fall apart and I would sink into an unbearable depression without them 
   -I worried would be nothing If I ever quit taking them so I never planned on stopping 
   
I’ve been off for about 7 months now and I’ve never felt healthier or in better shape in my life

My resting heart rate used to rarely come below 100 bpm whole on anabolics and drugs, it’s now in the 60s

I would never recommend anabolic steroids to anybody for any reason

No reason or excuse is worth the damage and torture I went through taking various steroids with their horrendous side effects over the years 

My body has recovered and is seeing natural progress again, including a healthy sex drive 

Drugs should never be used to band aid problems, quick fixes will just lead to worse long term problems down the road
