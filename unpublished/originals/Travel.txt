Travel 
by Justin Tyler

She wants to travel
I said baby, take a ride with me 
We'll both split a capsule
Maybe we'll have a couple drinks
Let our thoughts unravel
Tell me what you really think 
Leave this world behind
Forget our worries and securities
Be with just each other, no superficial things

She said okay let's do it
I wish she never trusted me 
I can't even trust myself
Promised her everything
Can't take it back
We already booked the flight
The trip is on tonight
About to get so high
Come up feeling like we just might die
Stay up all night
Spilling out our souls
Not a single lie
Telling every truth 
LIke we'll never say goodbye
These substances taste like pestocides

She pleads please never leave me
Tell me you're never leaving
She never wants this to end
My heart feels like it's bleeding
Wondering why I let it begin
Why did I do this shit again? 
She wants me to save her
I can't even save myself
Begs me to slave her
Never wants anybody else

Says she no longer wants to travel
Just wants me
Instead I gave her hell 
And a useless note
Xoxo I wish you so well 
Hope you get better
Hope you outgrow your shell 
Hope you outlast the weather
And that you truly grow

Hope you heal from this broken heart
I hope you still travel
Your minds a work of art
I'm sorry I had to leave you 
Knowing there is no restart
But I had to help myself
My soul was burning, my body starved
Still think of you when I see the stars
Know I'll always love you 
From the bottom of my heart
Never forget you
So until the next life
I'll be waiting for our next trip 
Xoxo, forgive and please never forget
